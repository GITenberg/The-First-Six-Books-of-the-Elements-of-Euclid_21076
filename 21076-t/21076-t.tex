\noindent This edition of the Elements of Euclid, undertaken
at the request of the principals of some of
the leading Colleges and Schools of Ireland, is
intended to supply a want much felt by teachers
at the present day---the production of a work
which, while giving the unrivalled original in
all its integrity, would also contain the modern
conceptions and developments of the portion of
Geometry over which the Elements extend. A
cursory examination of the work will show that
the Editor has gone much further in this latter
direction than any of his predecessors, for it will
be found to contain, not only more actual matter
than is given in any of theirs with which he is
acquainted, but also much of a special character,
which is not given, so far as he is aware, in any
former work on the subject. The great extension
%[File: 010.png]
of geometrical methods in recent times has made
such a work a necessity for the student, to enable
him not only to read with advantage, but even to
understand those mathematical writings of modern
times which require an accurate knowledge
of Elementary Geometry, and to which it is in
reality the best introduction.

In compiling his work the Editor has received
invaluable assistance from the late Rev.\ Professor
Townsend\index{Townsend}, \textsc{s.f.t.c.d.} The book was rewritten
and considerably altered in accordance with his
suggestions, and to that distinguished Geometer
it is largely indebted for whatever merit it possesses.

The Questions for Examination in the early part
of the First Book are intended as specimens,
which the teacher ought to follow through the
entire work. Every person who has had experience
in tuition knows well the importance
of such examinations in teaching Elementary
Geometry.

The Exercises, of which there are over eight
hundred, have been all selected with great care.
Those in the body of each Book are intended as
applications of Euclid's Propositions. They are
%[File: 011.png]
for the most part of an elementary character, and
may be regarded as common property, nearly
every one of them having appeared already in
previous collections. The Exercises at the end
of each Book are more advanced; several are
due to the late Professor Townsend, some are
original, and a large number have been taken
from two important French works---\textsc{Catalan's}\index{Catalan}
\textit{Théorèmes et Problèmes de Géométrie Elémentaire},
and the \textit{Traité de Géométrie}, by \textsc{Rouché}\index{Rouché} and
\textsc{De Comberousse}\index{Comberousse}.

The second edition has been thoroughly revised
and greatly enlarged. The new matter includes
several alternative proofs, important examination
questions on each of the books, an explanation of
the ratio of incommensurable quantities, the first
twenty-one propositions of Book XI\@., and an
Appendix on the properties of the Prism, Pyramids,
Cylinder, Sphere, and Cone.

The present Edition has been very carefully
read throughout, and it is hoped that few misprints
have escaped detection.

The Editor is glad to find from the rapid sale of
former editions (each 3000 copies) of his Book, and
its general adoption in schools, that it is likely to
%[File: 012.png]
accomplish the double object with which it was
written, viz.\ to supply students with a Manual
that will impart a thorough knowledge of the
immortal work of the great Greek Geometer, and
introduce them, at the same time, to some of the
most important conceptions and developments of
the Geometry of the present day.

{\Large INTRODUCTION.}
\end{center}


\noindent Geometry is the Science of figured Space. Figured
Space is of one, two, or three dimensions, according
as it consists of lines, surfaces, or solids. The
boundaries of solids are surfaces; of surfaces, lines;
and of lines, points. Thus it is the province of
Geometry to investigate the properties of solids,
of surfaces, and of the figures described on surfaces.
The simplest of all surfaces is the plane,
and that department of Geometry which is occupied
with the lines and curves drawn on a plane
is called \textit{Plane Geometry}; that which demonstrates
the properties of solids, of curved surfaces, and the
figures described on curved surfaces, is \textit{Geometry}
%[File: 018.png]
\textit{of Three Dimensions}. The simplest lines that can
be drawn on a plane are the right line and circle,
and the study of the properties of the point, the
right line, and the circle, is the introduction to
Geometry, of which it forms an extensive and important
department. This is the part of Geometry
on which the oldest Mathematical Book in existence,
namely, Euclid's \textit{Elements}, is written, and
is the subject of the present volume. The \textit{conic
sections} and \textit{other curves} that can be described on
a plane form special branches, and complete the
divisions of this, the most comprehensive of all the
Sciences. The student will find in Chasles'\index{Chasles} \textit{Aperçu
Historique} a valuable history of the origin and
the development of the methods of Geometry.

In the following work, when figures are not
drawn, the student should construct them from the
given directions. The Propositions of Euclid will
be printed in larger type, and will be referred to
by Roman numerals enclosed in brackets. Thus
[III\@. \textsc{xxxii.}] will denote the 32nd Proposition
of the 3rd Book. The number of the Book will
be given only when different from that under
%[File: 019.png]
which the reference occurs. The general and the
particular enunciation of every Proposition will be
given in one. By omitting the letters enclosed
in parentheses we have the general enunciation,
and by reading them, the particular. The annotations
will be printed in smaller type. The
following symbols will be used in them:---

\begin{tabular}{l c c}
Circle & will be denoted by & $\bigodot$ \\
Triangle & ,, & $\triangle$ \\
Parallelogram & ,, & $\pgram$ \\
Parallel lines & ,, & $\parallel$ \\
Perpendicular & ,, & $\perp$
\end{tabular}

In addition to these we shall employ the usual
symbols $+$, $-$, \&c.\ of Algebra, and also the sign
of congruence, namely $\equiv$. This symbol has been
introduced by the illustrious Gauss.\index{Gauss}

\mybook{BOOK I}{Theory of Angles, Triangles, Parallel Lines, and parallelograms.}

\begin{center}
\textsc{The Point.}\index{Points}
\end{center}

\textsc{i.} A point is that which has position but not dimensions.

\begin{footnotesize}
A geometrical magnitude which has three dimensions, that is,
length, breadth, and thickness, is a solid; that which has two
dimensions, such as length and breadth, is a surface; and that
which has but one dimension is a line. But a point is neither a
solid, nor a surface, nor a line; hence it has no dimensions---that
is, it has neither length, breadth, nor thickness.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\begin{center}
\textsc{The Line.}\index{Line}
\end{center}

\textsc{ii}. A line is length without breadth.

\begin{footnotesize}
A line is space of one dimension. If it had any breadth, no
matter how small, it would be space of two dimensions; and if in
addition it had any thickness it would be space of three dimensions;
hence a line has neither breadth nor thickness.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{iii.} The intersections of lines and their extremities
are points.

%[File: 021.png]

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{108}{2}{f262}

\textsc{iv.} A line which lies evenly between its extreme
points is called a straight or right
line, such as $AB$.

\begin{footnotesize}
If a point move without changing its direction it will describe
a right line. The direction in which a point moves in called its
``\textit{sense}.'' If the moving point continually changes its direction
it will describe a curve; hence it follows that only one right line
can be drawn between two points. The following Illustration is
due to Professor Henrici\index{Henrici}:---``If we suspend a weight by a string,
the string becomes stretched, and we say it is straight, by which
we mean to express that it has assumed a peculiar definite shape.
If we mentally abstract from this string all thickness, we obtain
the notion of the simplest of all lines, which we call a straight
line.''
\par\end{footnotesize}

\begin{center}
\textsc{The Plane.}
\end{center}

\textsc{v.} A surface\index{Surface} is that which has length and breadth.

\begin{footnotesize}
A surface is space of two dimensions. It has no thickness, for if
it had any, however small, it would be space of three dimensions.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{vi.}  When a surface is such that the right line joining
any two arbitrary points in it lies wholly in the
surface, it is called a \textit{plane}.\index{Plane}

\begin{footnotesize}
A plane is perfectly flat and even, like the surface of still
water, or of a smooth floor.---\textsc{Newcomb}.\index{Newcomb}
\par\end{footnotesize}

\newpage
\begin{center}
\textsc{Figures.}\index{Figures}
\end{center}

\textsc{vii.} Any combination of points, of lines, or of points
and lines in a plane, is called a \textit{plane} figure. If a figure
be formed of points only it is called a \textit{stigmatic} figure;
and if of right lines only, a \textit{rectilineal} figure.\index{Figures!rectilineal}

\textsc{viii.} Points which lie on the same right line are
called \textit{collinear} points.\index{Points!collinear} A figure formed of collinear
points is called a \textit{row} of points.\index{Points!row of}

\begin{center}
\textsc{The Angle.}\index{Angle}
\end{center}

\textsc{ix.} The inclination of two right lines extending out
from one point in different directions is called a \textit{rectilineal}
angle.

%[File: 022.png]

\textsc{x.} The two lines are called the \textit{legs},\index{Angle!legs of} and the point
the \textit{vertex}\index{Angle!vertex of}\index{Vertex!of angle} of the angle.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{113}{11}{f001}
\begin{footnotesize}
A light line drawn from the vertex and turning about it in the
plane of the angle, from the position of coincidence with one leg
to that of coincidence with the other, is said to turn through the
angle, and the angle is the greater as the quantity of turning is
the greater. Again, since the line may turn from one position to
the other in either of two ways, two angles are formed by two
lines drawn from a point.

Thus if $AB$, $AC$ be the legs, a line
may turn from the position $AB$ to the
position $AC$ in the two ways indicated
by the arrows. The smaller of the angles
thus formed is to be understood as
the angle contained by the lines. The
larger, called a \textit{re-entrant} angle\index{Angle!re-entrant}, seldom
occurs in the ``Elements.''
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{xi.} \textit{Designation of Angles.}---A particular angle in a
figure is denoted by three letters, as $BAC$, of which the
middle one, $A$, is at the vertex, and the other two along
the legs. The angle is then read $BAC$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{300}{f002}

\textsc{xii.} The angle formed by joining two or more angles
together is called their \textit{sum}. Thus the sum of the two
angles $ABC$, $PQR$ is the angle $AB'R$,
\imgflow{129}{7}{f003}
%[Illustration]
formed by applying
the side $QP$ to the side $BC$, so that the vertex $Q$ shall
fall on the vertex $B$, and the
side $QR$ on the opposite side
of $BC$ from $BA$.

\textsc{xiii.} When the sum of two
angles $BAC$, $CAD$ is such that
the legs $BA$, $AD$ form one right
line, they are called \textit{supplements} of each other.

\begin{footnotesize}
Hence, when one line stands on another, the two angles which
it makes on the same side of that on which it stands are supplements
of each other.
\par\end{footnotesize}

%[File: 023.png]

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{121}{7}{f004}
\textsc{xiv}. When one line stands on another, and makes
the adjacent angles\index{Angle!adjacent} at both
sides of itself equal, each of
the angles is called a \textit{right}
angle\index{Angle!right}, and the line which
stands on the other is called
a \textit{perpendicular}\index{Lines!perpendicular} to it.


\begin{footnotesize}
Hence a right angle is equal to its supplement.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{xv}. An \textit{acute} angle\index{Angle!acute} is one which is less than a right
angle, as $A$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{266}{f005}

\textsc{xvi}. An \textit{obtuse} angle is one which is greater than a
right angle, as $BAC$.

\begin{footnotesize}
The supplement\index{Angle!supplement of} of an acute angle is obtuse, and conversely, the
supplement of an obtuse
angle is acute.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\imgflow{100}{7}{f006}
\textsc{xvii}. When the sum of two angles
is a right angle, each is called the
\textit{complement}\index{Angle!complement of} of the other. Thus, if
the angle $BAC$ be right, the angles
$BAD$, $DAC$ are complements of each
other.

\begin{center}
\textsc{Concurrent Lines.}\index{Lines!Concurrent}
\end{center}

\textsc{xviii}. Three or more right lines passing through the
same point are called \textit{concurrent} lines.

\textsc{xix}. A system of more than three concurrent lines is
called a \textit{pencil} of lines\index{Lines!pencil of}. Each line of a pencil is called
a \textit{ray}\index{Ray}, and the common point through which the rays
pass is called the \textit{vertex}\index{Vertex!of pencil}.

%[File: 024.png]

\begin{center}
\textsc{The Triangle.}\index{Triangle}
\end{center}

\textsc{xx}. A \textit{triangle} is a figure formed by three right
lines joined end to end. The three lines are called
its \textit{sides}.

\textsc{xxi}. A triangle whose three sides are unequal is said
to be \textit{scalene}\index{Triangle!scalene}, as $A$; a triangle having two sides equal,
to be \textit{isosceles}\index{Triangle!isosceles}, as $B$; and and having all its sides equal,
to be \textit{equilateral}\index{Triangle!equilateral}, as $C$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{233}{f007}

\textsc{xxii}. A \textit{right-angled} triangle\index{Triangle!right-angled} is one that has one of
its angles a right angle, as $D$. The side which subtends
the right angle is called the \textit{hypotenuse}\index{Hypotenuse}.

\textsc{xxiii}. An \textit{obtuse-angled} triangle\index{Triangle!obtuse-angled} is one that has one
of its angles obtuse\index{Angle!obtuse}, as $E$.

\textsc{xxiv}. An \textit{acute-angled} triangle is one that has its three
angles acute, as $F$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{233}{f008}

\textsc{xxv}. An \textit{exterior} angle\index{Angle!exterior} of a triangle is one that is
formed by any side and the continuation of another
side.

\begin{footnotesize}
Hence a triangle has six exterior angles; and also each exterior
angle is the supplement of the adjacent interior angle.
\par\end{footnotesize}


\begin{center}
\textsc{The Polygon.}\index{Polygon}
\end{center}

\textsc{xxvi}. A \textit{rectilineal} figure bounded by more than three
right lines is usually called a polygon.

\textsc{xxvii}. A polygon is said to be \textit{convex} when it has no
re-entrant angle.
%[File: 025.png]

\textsc{xxviii}. A polygon of four sides is called a \textit{quadrilateral}.\index{Quadrilateral}

\textsc{xxix}. A quadrilateral whose four sides are equal is
called a \textit{lozenge}.\index{Lozenge}

\textsc{xxx}. A lozenge which has a right angle is called a
\textit{square}.\index{Square}

\textsc{xxxi}. A polygon which has five sides is called a
\textit{pentagon}\index{Pentagon}; one which has six sides, a \textit{hexagon}, and so on.


\begin{center}
\textsc{The Circle.}
\end{center}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{95}{7}{f009}
\textsc{xxxii}. A \textit{circle}\index{Circle} is a plane figure formed by a curved
line called the \textit{circumference}\index{Circle!circumference}, and is
such that all right lines drawn
from a certain point within the
figure to the circumference are
equal to one another. This point
is called the \textit{centre}\index{Centre}.

\textsc{xxxiii}. A \textit{radius}\index{Circle!radius of} of a circle is
any right line drawn from the centre to the circumference,
such as $CD$.

\textsc{xxxiv}. A \textit{diameter}\index{Circle!diameter of} of a circle is a right line drawn
through the centre and terminated both ways by the
circumference, such as $AB$.

\begin{footnotesize}
From the definition of a circle it follows at once that the path
of a movable point in a plane which remains at a constant distance
from a fixed point is a circle; also that any point $P$ in the plane is
inside, outside, or on the circumference of a circle according as
its distance from the centre is \textit{less} than, \textit{greater} than, or \textit{equal} to,
the radius.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\begin{center}
\textsc{Postulates.}\index{Postulate}
\end{center}

Let it be granted that---

\textsc{i}. A right line may be drawn from any one point to
any other point.

\begin{footnotesize}
When we consider a straight line contained between two fixed
points which are its ends, such a portion is called a \textit{finite straight
line}.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{ii}. A terminated right line may be produced to any
length in a right line.

%[File: 026.png]

\begin{footnotesize}
Every right line may extend without limit in either direction
or in both. It is in these cases called an \textit{indefinite} line. By this
postulate a finite right line may be supposed to be produced,
whenever we please, into an indefinite right line.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{iii}. A circle may be described from any centre, and
with any distance from that centre as radius.

%[Illustration]

\imgflow{100}{3}{f010}
\begin{footnotesize}
If there be two points $A$ and $B$, and if with any instruments,
such as a ruler and pen, we draw a line
from $A$ to $B$, this will evidently have some
irregularities, and also some breadth and
thickness. Hence it will not be a geometrical line no matter how
nearly it may approach to one. This is the reason that Euclid
postulates the drawing of a right line from one point to another.
For if it could be accurately done there would be no need for his
asking us to let it be granted. Similar observations apply to the
other postulates. It is also worthy of remark that Euclid never
takes for granted the doing of anything for which a geometrical
construction, founded on other problems or on the foregoing postulates,
can be given.
\par\end{footnotesize}


\begin{center}
\textsc{Axioms.}\index{Axioms}
\end{center}

\textsc{i}. Things which are equal to the same, or to equals,
are equal to each other.

\begin{footnotesize}
Thus, if there be three things, and if the first, and the second,
be each equal to the third, we infer by this axiom that the first is
equal to the second. This axiom relates to all kinds of magnitude.
The same is true of Axioms \textsc{ii}., \textsc{iii}., \textsc{iv}., \textsc{v}., \textsc{vi}., \textsc{vii}., \textsc{ix}.;
but \textsc{viii}., \textsc{x}., \textsc{xi}., \textsc{xii}., are strictly geometrical.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{ii}. If equals be added to equals the sums will be
equal.

\textsc{iii}. If equals be taken from equals the remainders
will be equal.

\textsc{iv}. If equals be added to unequals the sums will be
unequal.

\textsc{v}. If equals be taken from unequals the remainders
will be unequal.

\textsc{vi}. The doubles of equal magnitudes are equal.

\textsc{vii}. The halves of equal magnitudes are equal.

\textsc{viii}. Magnitudes that can be made to coincide are
equal.
%[File: 027.png]

\begin{footnotesize}
The placing of one geometrical magnitude on another, such as a
line on a line, a triangle on a triangle, or a circle on a circle, \&c.,
is called \emph{superposition}. The superposition employed in Geometry
is only \emph{mental}, that is, we conceive one magnitude placed on the
other; and then, if we can prove that they coincide, we infer, by
the present axiom, that they are equal. Superposition involves the
following principle, of which, without explicitly stating it, Euclid
makes frequent use:---``Any figure may be transferred from one
position to another without change of form or size.''
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{ix}. The whole is greater than its part.

\begin{footnotesize}
This axiom is included in the following, which is a fuller statement:---
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{ix$'$}. The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts.

\textsc{x}. Two right lines cannot enclose a space.

\begin{footnotesize}
This is equivalent to the statement, ``If two right lines have two
points common to both, they coincide in direction,'' that is, they
form but one line, and this holds true even when one of the points
is at infinity.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{xi}. All right angles are equal to one another.

\begin{footnotesize}
This can be proved as follows:---Let there be two right lines
$AB$, $CD$, and two perpendiculars to them, namely, $EF$, $GH$, then
if $AB$, $CD$ be made to coincide by superposition, so that the point
$E$ will coincide with $G$; then since a right angle is equal to its
supplement, the line $EF$ must coincide with $GH$. Hence the
angle $AEF$ is equal to $CGH$.
\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{xii}. If two right lines $(AB,\ CD)$ meet a third line
$(AC)$, so as to make the sum
of the two interior angles
$(BAC,\ ACD)$ on the same
side less than two right angles,
these lines being produced
shall meet at some
\emph{finite distance}.

%[Illustration.]
\imgcent{132}{f011}

This axiom is the converse of Prop.~\textsc{xvii}., Book~I.
%[File: 028.png]


\begin{center}
\textsc{Explanation of Terms.}
\end{center}

\emph{Axioms}.---``Elements of human reason,'' according to
\textsc{Dugald Stewart}, are certain general propositions, the
truths of which are self-evident, and which are so fundamental,
that they cannot be inferred from any propositions
which are more elementary; in other words,
they are incapable of demonstration. ``That two sides
of a triangle are greater than the third'' is, perhaps,
self-evident; but it is not an axiom, inasmuch as it can
be inferred by demonstration from other propositions;
but we can give no proof of the proposition that
``things which are equal to the same are equal to one
another,'' and, being self-evident, it is an axiom.

\emph{Propositions}\index{Proposition} which are not axioms are properties of
figures obtained by processes of reasoning. They are
divided into theorems and problems.

A \emph{Theorem}\index{Theorem} is the formal statement of a property that
may be demonstrated from known propositions. These
propositions may themselves be theorems or axioms. A
theorem consists of two parts, the \emph{hypothesis}\index{Hypothesis}, or that
which is assumed, and the \emph{conclusion}\index{Conclusion}, or that which is
asserted to follow therefrom. Thus, in the typical
theorem,
\[
  \text{\ If } X \text{\ is } Y,\text{\ then }Z \text{\ is } W,
\tag{\textsc{i.}}
\]
the hypothesis is that $X$ is $Y$, and the conclusion is
that $Z$ is $W$.

\emph{Converse Theorems}\index{Theorem!converse of}\index{Proposition!converse of}.---Two theorems are said to be
converse, each of the other, when the hypothesis of
either is the conclusion of the other. Thus the converse
of the theorem (\textsc{i}.) is---
\[
  \text{\ If } Z \text{\ is } W, \text{\ then } X \text{\ is } Y.
\tag{\textsc{ii}.}
\]

From the two theorems (\textsc{i.}) and (\textsc{ii.}) we may infer
%[File: 029.png]
two others, called their \emph{contrapositives}\index{Contrapositive}\index{Proposition!contrapositive of}. Thus the contrapositive
\begin{align*}
&\text{of (\textsc{i}.) is, If $Z$ is not $W$, then $X$ is not $Y$;} \tag{\textsc{iii}.}
\\
&\text{of (\textsc{ii}.) is, If $X$ is not $Y$, then $Z$ is not $W$.} \tag{\textsc{iv}.}
\end{align*}

The theorem (\textsc{iv}.) is called the \emph{obverse}\index{Propositions!obverse of} of (\textsc{i}.), and
(\textsc{iii}.) the obverse of (\textsc{ii}.).

A \emph{Problem}\index{Problem} is a proposition in which something is
proposed to be done, such as a line to be drawn, or a
figure to be constructed, under some given conditions.

The \emph{Solution}\index{Solution} of a problem is the method of construction
which accomplishes the required end.

The \emph{Demonstration}\index{Demonstration} is the proof, in the case of a
theorem, that the conclusion follows from the hypothesis;
and in the case of a problem, that the construction
accomplishes the object proposed.

The \emph{Enunciation}\index{Enunciation} of a problem consists of two parts,
namely, the \emph{data}, or things supposed to be given, and
the \emph{quaesita}, or things required to be done.

\emph{Postulates} are the elements of geometrical construction,
and occupy the same relation with respect to
problems as axioms do to theorems.

A \emph{Corollary}\index{Corollary} is an inference or deduction from a proposition.

A \emph{Lemma}\index{Lemma} is an auxiliary proposition required in the
demonstration of a principal proposition.

A \emph{Secant}\index{Secant} or \emph{Transversal}\index{Lines!transversal} is a line which cuts a system
of lines, a circle, or any other geometrical figure.

\emph{Congruent}\index{Congruent} figures are those that can be made to
coincide by superposition. They agree in shape and
size, but differ in position. Hence it follows, by
Axiom~\textsc{viii}., that corresponding parts or portions of
congruent figures are congruent, and that congruent
figures are equal in every respect.

\emph{Rule of Identity}\index{Identity, rule of}.---Under this name the following
principle will be sometimes referred to:---``If there is
but one $X$ and one $Y$, then, from the fact that $X$ is $Y$,
it necessarily follows that $Y$ is $X$.''---\textsc{Syllabus}.

$DA$ is equal to $DB$ (Def.~\textsc{xxi.}). Hence we have

$AF$ is equal to the remainder $BE$ (Axiom~\textsc{iii.}). Again,
because $B$ is the centre of the circle $ECH$, $BC$ is equal
to $BE$; and we have proved that $AF$ is equal to $BE$;

It is usual with commentators on Euclid to say that he allows
the use of the \emph{rule} and \emph{compass}. Were such the case this Proposition
would have been unnecessary. The fact is, Euclid's object
was to teach Theoretical and not Practical Geometry, and the only
things he postulates are the drawing of right lines and the describing
of circles. If he allowed the mechanical use of the rule and
compass he could give methods of solving many problems that
go beyond the limits of the ``geometry of the point, line, and
circle.''---\textit{See} Notes D, F at the end of this work.

\textbf{Dem.}---Let us conceive the triangle $BAC$ to be applied
to $EDF$, so that the
point $A$ shall coincide with
$D$, and the line $AB$ with
$DE$, and that the point $C$
shall be on the same side

coincide with two points of the line $EF$; and since two
right lines cannot enclose a space, $BC$ must coincide

Prop.~\textsc{xxxii.})
\par\end{footnotesize}


\mypropl{PROP\@.~V.---Theorem.}{The angles $(ABC,\ ACB)$ at the base $(BC)$ of an isosceles
triangle are equal to one another, and if the equal sides
$(AB,\ AC)$ be produced, the external angles $(DEC,\ ECB)$

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{128}{12}{f016}

\textbf{Dem.}---In $BD$ take any point $F$, and from $AE$, the
greater, cut off $AG$ equal to
$AF$ [\textsc{iii}]. Join $BG$, $CF$
(Post.~\textsc{i.}). Because $AF$ is
equal to $AG$ (const.), and $AC$
is equal to $AB$ (hyp.), the
two triangles $FAC$, $GAB$
have the sides $FA$, $AC$ in
one respectively equal to the
sides $GA$, $AB$ in the other;
and the included angle $A$ is
common to both triangles.
Hence [\textsc{iv.}] the base $FC$ is
equal to $GB$, the angle $AFC$ is equal to $AGB$, and the
angle $ACF$ is equal to the angle $ABG$.

Again, because $AF$ is equal to $AG$ (const.), and $AB$
to $AC$ (hyp.), the remainder, $BF$, is equal to $CG$ (Axiom
\textsc{iii}); and we have proved that $FC$ is equal to $GB$, and
%[File: 036.png]
the angle $BFC$ equal to the angle $CGB$. Hence the
two triangles $BFC$, $CGB$ have the two sides $BF$, $FC$ in
one equal to the two sides $CG$, $GB$ in the other; and the
angle $BFC$ contained by the two sides of one equal to the
angle $CGB$ contained by the two sides of the other.
Therefore [\textsc{iv.}] these triangles have the angle $FBC$
equal to the angle $GCB$, \emph{and these are the angles below
the base}. Also the angle $FCB$ equal to $GBC$; but the
whole angle $FCA$ has been proved equal to the whole
angle $GBA$. Hence the remaining angle $ACB$ is equal
to the remaining angle $ABC$, \emph{and these are the angles
at the base}.

\begin{footnotesize}
%[Illustration]
\imgflow{145}{9}{f017}

\smallskip
\textbf{Observation.}---The great difficulty which beginners find in this
Proposition is due to the fact
that the two triangles $ACF$,
$ABG$ overlap each other.
The teacher should make
these triangles separate, as
in the annexed diagram, and
point out the corresponding
parts thus:---
\begin{align*}
  AF & = AG,  \\
  AC & = AB;  \\
\text{angle } FAC &= \text{angle } GAB.
\end{align*}

\begin{flalign*}
& \text{\indent Hence [\textsc{iv.}],} &
  \text{angle } ACF &= \text{angle } ABG.  &&\\
& \text{and } &
  \text{angle } AFC &= \text{angle } AGB.  &&
\end{flalign*}

The student should also be shown how to apply one of the
triangles to the other, so as to bring them into coincidence. Similar
Illustrations may be given of the triangles $BFC$, $CGB$.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{110}{10}{f018}

The following is a very easy proof of this Proposition. Conceive
the $\triangle~ACB$ to be turned, without
alteration, round the line $AC$,
until it falls on the other side. Let
$ACD$ be its new position; then the
angle $ADC$ of the displaced triangle is
evidently equal to the angle $ABC$, with
which it originally coincided. Again,
the two $\triangle s~BAC$, $CAD$ have the sides
$BA$, $AC$ of one respectively equal to
the sides $AC$, $AD$ of the other, and
the included angles equal; therefore [\textsc{iv.}] the angle $ACB$ opposite
%[File: 037.png]
to the side $AB$ is equal to the angle $ADC$ opposite to the
side $AC$; but the angle $ADC$ is equal to $ABC$; therefore $ACB$
is equal to $ABC$.

the two sides $DB$, $BC$ in one are

[\textsc{iv.}] the triangle $DBC$ is equal to the triangle

Hence, adding the angle $ABD$, the sum of the angles

$CBA$, $ABD$ is equal to the sum of the three angles $CBE$,
$EBA$, $ABD$. In like manner, the sum of the angles
$CBE$, $EBD$ is equal to the sum of the three angles

the line $CE$ stands on $AB$,
the sum of the angles $BEC$,
$CEA$ is two right angles; therefore
the sum of the angles $CEA$,

the angle $BGH$ equal

1.~Let the equal sides be $BC$ and $EF$; then if $DE$ be

$ABG$, $DEF$ have
the two sides $AB$, $BG$

$AGB$ is equal to $ACB$, that is, the exterior angle of
the triangle $ACG$ is equal to the interior and non-adjacent

the line $EA$ will occupy the place of $FD$, and the line
$FD$ the place of $EA$; therefore the lines $AB$, $CD$ interchange

Then because $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $AD$ is equal
to $BC$ [\textsc{xxxiv}.]; and since $BCEF$ is a parallelogram, $EF$
is equal to $BC$; therefore (see fig.~($\alpha$)) take away $ED$,
and in fig.~($\beta$) add $ED$, and we have in each case $AE$
equal to $DF$, and $BA$ is equal to $CD$ [\textsc{xxxiv}.]. Hence
the triangles $BAE$, $CDF$ have the two sides $BA$, $AE$ in
one respectively equal to the two sides $CD$, $DF$ in the
other, and the angle $BAE$ [\textsc{xxix}.] equal to the angle
$CDF$; hence [\textsc{iv}.] the triangle $BAE$ is equal to the triangle
$CDF$; and taking each of these triangles in succession
from the quadrilateral $BAFC$, \emph{there will remain
the parallelogram $BCFE$ equal to the parallelogram $BCDA$.}

\emph{Or thus:} The triangles $ABE$, $DCF$ have [\textsc{xxxiv}.]
the sides $AB$, $BE$ in one respectively equal to the sides
%[File: 071.png]
$DC$, $CF$ in the other, and the angle $ABE$ equal to the
angle $DCF$ [\textsc{xxix}., Ex.~8]. Hence the triangle $ABE$ is
equal to the triangle $DCF$; and, taking each away from
the quadrilateral $BAFC$, \emph{there will remain the parallelogram
$BCFE$ equal to the parallelogram $BCDA$.}\par\medskip

of the demonstration into cases is avoided. It is easy to see that
either of the two parallelograms $ABCD$, $EBCF$ can be divided
into parts and rearranged so as to make it congruent with the
other. This Proposition affords the first instance in the Elements
in which equality which is not congruence occurs. This equality
is expressed algebraically by the symbol $=$, while congruence
is denoted by $\equiv$, called also the symbol of identity. Figures that

is two right angles;
therefore $BC$, $CH$ are

[\textsc{xiv}.]. In like manner
$AC$, $CD$ are in the

because $BAG$ is the
angle of a square it is a right angle: in like manner
$CAK$ is a right angle. Hence $BAG$ is equal to $CAK$:
to each add $BAC$, and we get the angle $CAG$ equal to
%[File: 083.png]
$KAB$. Again, since $BG$ and $CK$ are squares, $BA$ is
equal to $AG$, and $CA$ to $AK$. Hence the two triangles
$CAG$, $KAB$ have the sides $CA$, $AG$ in one respectively
equal to the sides $KA$, $AB$ in the other, and the contained

the triangles are equal; but the parallelogram $AL$ is
double of the triangle $CAG$ [\textsc{xli}.], because they are on

$AH$ is double
of the triangle $KAB$, because they are on the same base

since doubles of equal things are equal (Axiom \textsc{vi}.),
the parallelogram $AL$ is equal to $AH$. In like manner

$BD$. \emph{Hence the whole square $AF$ is equal to the sum of

\emph{Or thus:} Let all the squares be made in reversed directions.
Join $CG$, $BK$, and through $C$ draw $OL$
parallel to $AG$. Now, taking the $\angle BAC$
from the right $\angle$s $BAG$, $CAK$, the remaining
$\angle$s $CAG$, $BAK$ are equal.
Hence the $\triangle$s $CAG$, $BAK$ have the side
$CA = AK$, and $AG = AB$, and the
$\angle CAG= BAK$; therefore [\textsc{iv}.] they are
equal; and since [\textsc{xli}.] the $\pgram$s $AL$, $AH$
are respectively the doubles of these
triangles, they are equal. In like manner
the $\pgram$s  $BL$, $BD$ are equal; hence
the whole square $AF$ is equal to the
sum of the two squares $AH$, $BD$.

This proof is shorter than the usual
one, since it is not necessary to prove
that $AC$, $CD$ are in one right line. In a similar way the
Proposition may be proved by taking any of the eight figures
formed by turning the squares in all possible directions. Another
simplification of the proof would be got by considering that the
point $A$ is such that one of the $\triangle$s $CAG$, $BAK$ can be turned
round it in its own plane until it coincides with the other; and
hence that they are congruent.

times the area of the triangle (\emph{see} fig., \textsc{xlvi}., Ex.~3).  More
generally, if the vertical angle of a triangle be equal to the angle
of a regular polygon of $n$ sides, then the regular polygon of
$n$ sides, described on a line equal to the sum of its sides, exceeds
the area of the regular polygon of $n$ sides described on the base
by $n$ times the area of the triangle.

from the opposite vertex.

15.~On $BE$, a part of the side $BC$ of a square $ABCD$, is
described the square $BEFG$, having its side $BG$ in the continuation
of $AB$; it is required to divide the figure $AGFECD$ into
three parts which will form a square.

16.~Four times the sum of the squares on the medians which
bisect the sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to five times
the square on the hypotenuse.

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XLVIII\@.---Theorem.}{If the square on one side $(AB)$ of a triangle be equal to
the sum of the squares on the remaining sides $(AC,\ CB)$,
the angle $(C)$ opposite to that side is a right angle.}

\imgflow{107}{9}{f070}

\textbf{Dem.}---Erect $CD$ at right angles to $CB$ [\textsc{xi}.], and
make $CD$ equal to $CA$ [\textsc{iii}.]. Join
$BD$. Then because $AC$ is equal
to $CD$, the square on $AC$ is equal
to the square on $CD$: to each add
the square on $CB$, and we have the
sum of the squares on $AC$, $CB$
equal to the sum of the squares
on $CD$, $CB$; but the sum of the
squares on $AC$, $CB$ is equal to the
square on $AB$ (hyp.), and the sum of the squares on
$CD$, $CB$ is equal to the square on $BD$ [\textsc{xlvii}.]. Therefore
the square on $AB$ is equal to the square on $BD$.
Hence $AB$ is equal to $BD$ [\textsc{xlvi}., Ex.~1]. Again, because
$AC$ is equal to $CD$ (const.), and $CB$ common to
the two triangles $ACB$, $DCB$, and the base $AB$ equal
to the base $DB$, the angle $ACB$ is equal to the angle
$DCB$; but the angle $DCB$ is a right angle (const.).
\emph{Hence the angle $ACB$ is a right angle.}\par\medskip

\begin{footnotesize}
The foregoing proof forms an exception to Euclid's demonstrations
of converse propositions, for it
is direct. The following is an indirect
proof:---If $CB$ be not at right
angles to $AC$, let $CD$ be perpendicular
to it. Make $CD = CB$. Join $AD$.
Then, as before, it can be proved
that $AD$ is equal to $AB$, and $CD$ is
equal to $CB$ (const.). This is contrary
to Prop.~\textsc{vii}. \emph{Hence the angle $ACB$ is a right angle.}

\noindent Every Proposition in the Second Book has either a
square or a rectangle\index{Rectangle} in its enunciation. Before commencing
it the student should read the following preliminary
explanations: by their assistance it will be
seen that this Book, which is usually considered difficult,
will be rendered not only easy, but almost intuitively
evident.\par\medskip

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~As the linear unit is that by which we express all
linear measures, so the square unit is that to which all
superficial measures are referred. Again, as there are
different linear units in use, such as in this country,
inches, feet, yards, miles, \&c., and in France, metres,
and their multiples or sub-multiples, so different square
units are employed.

2.~A square unit is the square described on a line
whose length is the linear unit. Thus a square inch is
the square described on a line whose length is an inch;
a square foot is the square described on a line whose
length is a foot, \&c.

3.~If we take a linear foot, describe a square on it,
divide two adjacent sides each into twelve equal parts,
and draw parallels to the sides, we evidently divide the
square foot into square inches; and as there will manifestly
be 12 rectangular parallelograms, each containing
12 square inches, the square foot contains 144
square inches.
%[File: 093.png]

In the same manner it can be shown that a square
yard contains 9 square feet; and so in general the
square described on any line contains $n^2$ times the
square described on the $n^{th}$ part of the line. Thus, as
a simple case, the square on a line is four times the
square on its half. On account of this property the
second power of a quantity is called its square; and,
conversely, the square on a line $AB$ is expressed symbolically
by $AB^2$.

4.~If a rectangular parallelogram be such that two
adjacent sides contain respectively $m$ and $n$ linear units,
by dividing one side into $m$ and the other into $n$ equal
parts, and drawing parallels to the sides, the whole area
is evidently divided into $mn$ square units. Hence the
area of the parallelogram is found by multiplying its
length by its breadth, and this explains why we say
(\emph{see} Def.~\textsc{iv}.) a rectangle is contained by any two adjacent
sides; for if we multiply the length of one by
the length of the other we have the area. Thus, if
$AB$, $AD$ be two adjacent sides of a rectangle, the rectangle
is expressed by $AB\,.\,AD$.

\textsc{i}. If a point $C$ be taken in a line $AB$, the parts $AC$,
$CB$ are called \emph{segments}\index{Lines!segment of}, and $C$ a
\emph{point of division}.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{140}{2}{f073}

\textsc{ii}. If C be taken in the line $AB$ produced, $AC$, $CB$ are
still called the segments of
the line $AB$; but $C$ is called
a point of \emph{external} division.

\textsc{iii}. A parallelogram whose angles are right angles is
called a \emph{rectangle}.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{135}{8}{f074}

\textsc{iv}. A rectangle is said to
be contained by any two adjacent
sides. Thus the rectangle
$ABCD$ is said to be contained
by $AB$, $AD$, or by $AB$, $BC$,
\&c.

%[File: 094.png]
\textsc{v}. The rectangle contained by two separate lines
such as $AB$ and
$CD$ is the parallelogram
formed by erecting a perpendicular to $AB$, at
$A$, equal to $CD$, and drawing parallels: the area of the
rectangle will be $AB\,.\,CD$.

\textsc{vi}. In any parallelogram the figure which is composed
of either of the parallelograms
about a diagonal
and the two complements
[\emph{see} I., \textsc{xliii}.] is called a
gnomon. Thus, if we take
away either of the parallelograms
$AO$, $OC$ from the
parallelogram $AC$, the remainder
is called a \emph{gnomon}.\index{Gnomon}


\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Propositions \textsc{i.--xiv.,}}
\mypropl{PROP\@.~I.---Theorem.}{If there be two lines $(A,\ BC)$, one of which is divided
into any number of parts $(BD,\ DE,\ EC)$, the rectangle
contained by the two lines $(A,\ BC)$, is equal to the sum of
the rectangles contained by the undivided line $(A)$ and the
several parts of the divided line.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{185}{8}{f077}

\textbf{Dem.}---Erect $BF$ at right angles to $BC$ [I., \textsc{xi}.] and
make it equal to $A$. Complete the parallelogram $BK$
(Def.~\textsc{v}.). Through
$D$, $E$ draw $DG$, $EH$
parallel to $BF$. Because
the angles at
$B$, $D$, $E$ are right
angles, each of the
quadrilaterals $BG$,
$DH$, $EK$ is a rectangle.
Again, since $A$ is equal to $BF$ (const.), the
rectangle contained by $A$ and $BC$ is the rectangle contained
by $BF$ and $BC$ (Def.~\textsc{v}.); but $BK$ is the rectangle
contained by $BF$ and $BC$. Hence the rectangle
%[File: 095.png]
contained by $A$ and $BC$ is $BK$. In like manner the
rectangle contained by $A$ and $BD$ is $BG$. Again, since
$A$ is equal to $BF$ (const.), and $BF$ is equal to $DG$
[I.~\textsc{xxxiv}.], $A$ is equal to $DG$. Hence the rectangle
contained by $A$ and $DE$ is the figure $DH$ (Def.~\textsc{v}.). In
like manner the rectangle contained by $A$ and $EC$ is
the figure $EK$. Hence we have the following identities:---
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c@{\ }c@{\ }r@{\ }c@{\ }c}
Rectangle & contained & by $A$ & and & $BD \equiv BG$.  \\
    ,,    &     ,,    &    $A$ & ,,  & $DE \equiv DH$.  \\
    ,,    &     ,,    &    $A$ & ,,  & $EC \equiv EK$.  \\
    ,,    &     ,,    &    $A$ & ,,  & $BC \equiv BK$.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

But $BK$ is equal to the sum of $BG$, $DH$, $EK$
(I., Axiom~\textsc{ix}.). \emph{Therefore the rectangle contained by $A$
and $BC$ is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by
$A$ and $BD$, $A$ and $DE$, $A$ and $EC$.}\par\medskip

\begin{footnotesize}
If we denote the lines $BD$, $DE$, $EC$ by $a$, $b$, $c$, the Proposition
asserts that the rectangle contained by $A$, and $a+b+c$ is equal to
the sum of the rectangles contained by $A$ and $a$, $A$ and $b$, $A$ and $c$,
or, as it may be written, $A (a+b+c) = Aa + Ab + Ac$. This corresponds
to the distributive law in multiplication, and shows that
rectangles in Geometry, and products in Arithmetic and Algebra,
are subject to the same rules.\par\medskip

\textbf{Illustration.}---Suppose $A$ to be 6 inches; $BD$, 5 inches;
$DE$, 4 inches; $EC$, 3 inches; then $BC$ will be 12 inches; and
the rectangles will have the following values:---
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c@{\ }c@{\ }c}
Rectangle & $A\,.\,BC = 6\times 12 = 72$ & square inches.  \\
    ,,    & $A\,.\,BD = 6\times \phantom{1}5 = 30$ &  ,,   \\
    ,,    & $A\,.\,DE = 6\times \phantom{1}4 = 24$ &  ,,   \\
    ,,    & $A\,.\,EC = 6\times \phantom{1}3 = 18$ &  ,,
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now the sum of the three last rectangles, viz. 30, 24, 18, is 72.
Hence the rectangle $A\,.\,BC = A\,.\,BD + A\,.\,DE + A\,.\,EC$.
\par\end{footnotesize}\medskip

The Second Book is occupied with the relations between
the segments of a line divided in various ways.
All these can be proved in the most simple manner
by Algebraic Multiplication. We recommend the student
%[File: 096.png]
to make himself acquainted with the proofs by
this method as well as with those of Euclid. He will
thus better understand the meaning of each Proposition.\par\medskip

\emph{Cor.~\textrm{1}.---The rectangle contained by a line and the
difference of two others is equal to the difference of the
rectangles contained by the line and each of the others.}

\emph{Cor.~\textrm{2}.---The area\index{Area} of a triangle is equal to half the
rectangle contained by its base and perpendicular.}\par\medskip

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{120}{7}{f078}

\textbf{Dem.}---From the vertex $C$ let fall the perpendicular
$CD$. Draw $EF$ parallel to $AB$,
and $AE$, $BF$ each parallel to
$CD$. Then $AF$ is the rectangle

Now since $AE$ is equal to $AB$,
the angle $ABE$ is equal to $AEB$

equal to $CGB$ [I.~\textsc{xxix}.]. Hence
the angle $CBG$ is equal to $CGB$,

Again, since $CB$ is equal to $CG$, the rectangle $AC\,.\,CB$

$AG$, $GD$ are together equal to twice the

Because $AC$ is equal to $CE$,

the angle $CEA$ is half a right

Again, since $AC$ is equal to $CE$, $AC^2$ is equal to

$=$ to $BCE$ [I.\ \textsc{xxix}.],

$DBF$ is $=$ to $EBC$;
but the sum of the

less than two right angles [I.\ \textsc{xvii}.]; therefore the sum

will meet. Let them meet in $F$. Through $F$
draw $FG$ parallel to $AB$, and produce $EC$ to meet it in

Because $AC$ is equal to $CE$, and the angle $ACE$ is right,
the angle $CEA$ is half a right angle. In like manner
the angles $CEB$, $CBE$ are half right angles; therefore
the whole angle $AEF$ is right. Again, because $GF$

therefore $EGF$ is right, and $GEF$ has been proved to

Again, since $AC$ is equal to $CE$, $AC^2$ is equal to $CE^2$;
but $AE^2$ is equal to $AC^2$ + $CE^2$ [I.\ \textsc{xlvii}.]; therefore
$AE^2$ is equal to $2AC^2$. In like manner $EF^2$ is equal to

Hence, if a line be divided in extreme and mean ratio,
the greater segment will be cut in the same manner

it is evident that $CD$ is not a common measure of $AC$

of $AC$ and $CD$, and therefore not a common measure of
$AB$ and $AC$. Hence, no matter how far we proceed
we cannot arrive at any remainder which will be a

triangle.

6.~Divide a given line into two parts, so that the rectangle
contained by the whole and one segment may be equal to any
multiple of the square on the other segment.

7.~If $P$ be any point in the diameter $AB$ of a semicircle, and
$CD$ any parallel chord, then
\[
CP^2 + PD^2 = AP^2 + PB^2.
\]

8.~If $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ be four collinear points taken in order,
\[
AB\,.\,CD + BC\,.\,AD = AC\,.\,BD.

10.~In any triangle, three times the sum of the squares on the

11.~If perpendiculars be drawn from the angular points of a
square to any line, the sum of the squares on the perpendiculars
from one pair of opposite angles exceeds twice the rectangle
of the perpendiculars from the other pair by the area of the

12.~If the base $AB$ of a triangle be divided in $D$, so that $mAD
= nBD$, then
\[
mAC^2 + nBC^2 = mAD^2 + nDB^2 + (m + n) CD^2.
\]

13.~If the point $D$ be taken in $AB$ produced, so that $mAD

\[
mAC^2 - nBC^2 = mAD^2 - nDB^2 + (m - n) CD^2.
\]

14.~Given the base of a triangle in magnitude and position,
and the sum or the difference of $m$ times the square on one side
and $n$ times the square on the other side, in magnitude, the locus

15.~Any rectangle is equal to half the rectangle contained by
the diagonals of squares described on its adjacent sides.

16.~If $A$, $B$, $C$. \&c., be any number of fixed points, and $P$ a

given in magnitude.

17.~If the area of a rectangle be given, its perimeter is a minimum
when it is a square.

%[File: 121.png]

18.~If a transversal cut in the points $A$, $C$, $B$ three lines
issuing from a point $D$, prove that
\[
BC\,.\,AD^2 + AC\,.\,BD^2 - AB\,.\,CD^2 = AB\,.\,BC\,.\,CA.
\]

19.~Upon the segments $AC$, $CB$ of a line $AB$ equilateral triangles
are described: prove that if $D$, $D'$ be the centres of circles
described about these triangles, $6DD'^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 + CB^2$.

20.~If $a$, $b$, $p$ denote the sides of a right-angled triangle about
the right angle, and the perpendicular from the right angle on

This is a theorem, and not a definition. For if two circles

If the chord be produced both ways, the whole line is called a
secant, and each of the parts into which a secant divides the circumference

touch a circle when it meets
the circle, and, being produced
both ways, does not cut it;
the line is called a \emph{tangent}\index{Tangent}
to the circle, and the point
where it touches it the \emph{point
of contact.}\par\medskip

\begin{footnotesize}
In Modern Geometry a curve is considered as made up of an
infinite number of points, which are placed in order along the
curve, and then the secant through two consecutive points is a

tangent. Euclid's definition for a tangent is quite inadequate for
any curve but the circle, and those derived from it by projection
(the conic sections); and even for these the modern definition is
better.

species of contact\index{Circle!contact of}:---\\
1.~When each circle is

2.~When one is inside
the other.\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
The following is the modern definition of curve-contact:---
\emph{When two curves have two, three, four, \&c., consecutive points

\textsc{v.} A segment\index{Circle!segment of} of a circle is a figure bounded by a
chord and one of the arcs into which it divides the
circumference.

\textsc{vi.} Chords are said to be equally distant from the
centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from
the centre are equal.

\textsc{vii.} The angle contained by two lines, drawn from
any point in the circumference of a segment to the
extremities of its chord, is called an \emph{angle in the segment}.

\textsc{viii.} The angle of a segment is the angle contained
between its chord and the tangent at either extremity.\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
A theorem is tacitly assumed in this Definition, namely, that
the angles which the chord makes with the tangent at its extremities
are equal. We shall prove this further on.

the extended meaning of the word \emph{angle}\index{Angle!extension of meaning} in Modern

in Mechanics---in fact, in every application of
Geometry, and has been partly given in I.\ Def.\ \textsc{ix}.

Thus, if a line $OA$ revolve about the point $O$, as in
figures 1, 2, 3, 4, until it comes into the position $OB$,
the amount of the \emph{rotation} from $OA$ to $OB$ is called an
\emph{angle}. From the diagrams we see that in fig.~1 it is
less than two right angles; in fig.~2 it is equal to two
right angles; in fig.~3 greater than two right angles,
but less than four; and in fig.~4 it is greater than four
right angles. The arrow-heads denote the direction or
\emph{sense}, as it is technically termed, in which the line $OA$
turns. It is usual to call the direction indicated in the
above figures \emph{positive}, and the opposite \emph{negative.} A line
such as $OA$, which turns about a fixed point, is called
a \emph{ray}\index{Ray}, and then we have the following definition:---

\textsc{xvi}.\ A ray which turns in the sense \emph{opposite} to the
hands of a watch describes a \emph{positive angle}, and one
which turns in the \emph{same} direction as the hands, a
\emph{negative angle}.

\textbf{Sol}.---Take any two points $A$, $B$ in the circumference.
Join $AB$. Bisect it in $C$. Erect
$CD$ at right angles to $AB$. Produce
$DC$ to meet the circle again in $E$.
Bisect $DE$ in $F$. \emph{Then $F$ is the

\textbf{Dem}.---If possible, let any other
point $G$ be the centre. Join $GA$,
$GC$, $GB$. Then in the triangles
$ACG$, $BCG$ we have $AC$ equal to
$CB$ (const.), $CG$ common, and the
base $GA$ equal to $GB$, because they are drawn from $G$,
which is, by hypothesis, the centre, to the circumference.
Hence [I.\ \textsc{viii}.] the angle $ACG$ is equal to
the adjacent angle $BCG$, and therefore [I.\ Def.\ \textsc{xiii}.]
each is a right angle; but the angle $ACD$ is right
(const.); therefore $ACD$ is equal to $ACG$---a part equal
to the whole---which is absurd. Hence no point can
be the centre which is not in the line $DE$. \emph{Therefore $F$,
the middle point of $DE$, must be the centre.}

The foregoing proof may be abridged as follows:---\\
Because $ED$ bisects $AB$ at right angles, every point
equally distant from, the points $A$, $B$ must lie in $ED$
[I.\ \textsc{x.}\ Ex.\ 2]; but the centre is equally distant from
$A$ and $B$; hence the centre must be in $ED$; \emph{and since
it must be equally distant from $E$ and $D$, it must be the
middle point of $DE$.}

but the angle $ABC$ is equal
to $CAB$ [I.\ \textsc{v.}], because the
triangle $CAB$ is isosceles;
therefore the angle $ADC$ is
greater than $CAD$. Hence
$AC$ is greater than $CD$ [I.\ \textsc{xix.}]; therefore $CD$ is less
than the radius of the circle, consequently the point $D$
must be within the circle (note on I.\ Def.\ \textsc{xxiii.}).

In the same manner \textit{every other point between $A$ and

Now since $A$ is the centre

Hence the sum of the lines $AP$, $BP$ is equal to the

Hence the centre of the second circle must be

\textit{Or thus:} Since $BP$ is a line drawn from a point without

cannot have more than two points
common [\textsc{x.}], and that the point of contact
is equivalent to two common points,
circles that touch cannot have any
other point common. The following is
a formal proof of this Proposition:---Let
$O$, $O'$ be the centres of the two circles,
$A$ the point of contact, and let $O'$ lie
between $O$ and $A$; take any other point
$B$ in the circumference of $O$. Join $O'B$;
then [\textsc{vii.}] $O'B$ is greater than $O'A$; therefore the point $C$ is

be common to both circles. In like manner, they cannot have
any other common point but $A$.

\textbf{Dem.}---1. If possible let two circles touch each
other at two points $A$ and $B$.
Now since the two circles touch
each other in $A$, the line joining
their centres passes through $A$
[\textsc{xi.}]. In like manner, it passes
through $B$. Hence the centres
and the points $A$, $B$ are in one
right line; therefore $AB$ is a
diameter of each circle. Hence,
if $AB$ be bisected in $E$, $E$ must be the centre of each

impossible.}

2.~If two circles touched each other externally in

centres should pass through each point, \emph{which is impossible.}

\emph{Or thus:} Draw a line bisecting $AB$ at right angles.
Then this line [\textsc{i.}, \emph{Cor.}~1]\label{Icor1} must pass through the centre
of each circle, and therefore [\textsc{xi.~xii.}] must pass through
each point of contact, which is impossible. \emph{Hence two
circles cannot have double contact.}\par\medskip

\begin{footnotesize}
This Proposition is an immediate inference from the theorem
[\textsc{xii.}, \emph{Cor.}~1], that a point of contact counts for two intersections,
for then two contacts would be equivalent to four intersections;
but there cannot be more than two intersections [\textsc{x.}]. It also
follows from Prop.~\textsc{xii.}, \emph{Cor.}~2, that if two circles touch each
other in a point $A$, they cannot have any other point common;
\emph{hence they cannot touch again in $B$.}

Then because $AB$ is a chord in a

it bisects it [\textsc{iii.}]; therefore $AE$
is the half of $AB$. In like manner,
$CF$ is the half of $CD$; but $AB$
is equal to $CD$ (hyp.). Therefore
$AE$ is equal to $CF$ [I., Axiom~\textsc{vii.}].
And because $E$ is a right angle, $AO^{2}$ is equal to $AE^{2}
+ EO^{2}$. In like manner, $CO^{2}$ is equal to $CF^{2} + FO^{2}$;
but $AO^{2}$ is equal to $CO^{2}$. Therefore $AE^{2} + EO^{2}$ is
equal to $CF^{2} + FO^{2}$; and $AE^{2}$ has been proved equal to
$CF^{2}$. Hence $EO^{2}$ is equal to $FO^{2}$; therefore $EO$ is
equal to $FO$. \textit{Hence $AB$, $CD$ are} (Def.~\textsc{vi.}) \textit{equally

2.~Let $EO$ be equal to $FO$, it is required to prove $AB$
equal to $CD$. The same construction being made, we
have, as before, $AE^{2} + EO^{2}$ equal to $CF^{2} + FO^{2}$; but $EO^{2}$

2.~Because the chord $CD$ is nearer to the centre

$OGC$, $OHE$ are right-angled, we have $OC^{2} = OG^{2} + GC^{2}$,

$CI^{2}$ is greater than $CB^{2}$. Hence
$CI$ is greater than $CB$, and the
point $I$ [note on I., Def.~\textsc{xxxii.}]
is without the circle. In like
manner, every other point in

2.~To prove that $BH$, which is not perpendicular to

Now $BC^{2}$ is equal to $CG^{2} + GB^{2}$. Therefore $BC^{2}$ is
greater than $CG^{2}$, and $BC$ is greater than $CG$. Hence
[note on I., Def.~\textsc{xxxii.}] the point $G$ must be within
the circle, and consequently the line $BG$ produced

\emph{At every point on a circle the tangent is perpendicular

Let $P$ and $Q$ be two consecutive points on the circumference.
Join $CP$, $CQ$, $PQ$;

is a tangent (Def.~\textsc{iii.}). Again, the
sum of the three angles of the triangle
$CPQ$ is equal to two right
angles; but the angle $C$ is infinitely
small, and the others are equal.
Hence each of them is a right angle. \textit{Therefore the
tangent is perpendicular to the diameter.}

\textit{Or thus:} A tangent is a limiting position of a secant,
namely, when the secant moves out until the two
points of intersection with the circle become consecutive;
but the line through the centre which bisects
the part of the secant within the circle [\textsc{iii.}] is perpendicular
to it. \textit{Hence, in the limit the tangent is
perpendicular to the line from the centre to the point
of contact.}

\textit{Or again:} The angle $CPR$ is always equal to $CQS$;
hence, when $P$ and $Q$ come together each is a right
angle, \textit{and the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.}

($\beta$), and subtracting in ($\gamma$)), \emph{the angle $AOB$ is double of
the angle $ACB$.}\par\smallskip

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $O$ be the centre. Join $OA$, $OB$. Then
the angle $AOB$ is double of the angle $ACB$ [\textsc{xx.}], and
also double of the angle $ADB$. \textit{Therefore the angle
$ACB$ is equal to the angle $ADB$.}

The following is the proof of the second part---that
is, when the arc $AB$ is not greater than a semicircle,
without using angles greater than two right angles:---

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{115}{9}{f128}

Let $O$ be the centre. Join $CO$, and produce it to meet
the circle again in $E$. Join $DE$.
Now since $O$ is the centre, the
segment $ACE$ is greater than a
semicircle; hence, by the first
case, fig.~($\alpha$), the angle $ACE$ is
equal to $ADE$. In like manner
the angle $ECB$ is equal to $EDB$.
\textit{Hence the whole angle $ACB$ is
equal to the whole angle $ADB$.}

\emph{Cor.}~1.---If two triangles $ACB$, $ADB$ on the same
base $AB$, and on the same side of it, have equal vertical
angles, the four points $A$, $C$, $D$, $B$ are concyclic\label{concylic1}.

\emph{Cor.}~2.---If $A$, $B$ be two fixed points, and if $C$ varies
%[File: 148.png]
its position in such a way that the angle $ACB$ retains
the same value throughout, the locus of $C$ is a circle.

In other words---\emph{Given the base of a triangle and the
vertical angle, the locus of the vertex is a circle.}

inscribed in a circle is two right angles.}

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{225}{f129}

\textbf{Dem.}---Join $AC$, $BD$. The angle $ABD$ is equal to
$ACD$, being in the same segment $ABCD$ [\textsc{xxi.}]; and
%[File: 149.png]
the angle $DBC$ is equal to $DAC$, because they are in
the same segment $DABC$. Hence the whole angle $ABC$
is equal to the sum of the two angles $ACD$, $DAC$. To
each add the angle $CDA$, and we have the sum of the
two angles $ABC$, $CDA$ equal to the sum of the three
angles $ACD$, $DAC$, $CDA$ of the triangle $ACD$; but the
sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to two
right angles [I.~\textsc{xxxii.}]. \emph{Therefore the sum of $ABC$,
$CDA$ is two right angles.}

\emph{Or thus:} Let $O$ be the centre of the circle. Join
$OA$, $OC$ (\emph{see} fig.~2). Now the angle $AOC$ is double of
$CDA$ [\textsc{xx.}], and the angle $COA$ is double of $ABC$.
Hence the sum of the angles [I.~Def.~\textsc{ix.}, note]
$AOC$, $COA$ is double of the sum of the angles $CDA$,
$ABC$; but the sum of two angles $AOC$, $COA$ is four
right angles. \emph{Therefore the sum of the angles $CDA$,
$ABC$ is two right angles.}

\emph{Or again:} Let $O$ be the centre (fig.~2). Join $OA$, $OB$
$OC$, $OD$. Then the four triangles $AOB$, $BOC$, $COD$,
$DOA$ are each isosceles. Hence the angle $OAB$ is
equal to the angle $OBA$, and the angle $OAD$ equal to
the angle $ODA$; therefore the angle $BAD$ is equal to
the sum of the angles $OBA$, $ODA$. In like manner
the angle $BCD$ is equal to the sum of the angles $OBC$,
$ODC$. Hence the sum of the two angles $BAD$, $BCD$
is equal to the sum of the two angles $ABC$, $ADC$, \emph{and
hence each sum is two right angles.}

\textbf{Dem.}---1. Suppose the angles at the centres to be
given equal. Now because the circles are equal their
radii are equal (Def.~\textsc{i}.).
Therefore the
two triangles $AOB$,
$DHE$ have the sides
$AO$, $OB$ in one respectively
equal to
the sides $DH$, $HE$
in the other, and the
angle $AOB$ equal to
$DHE$ (hyp.). Therefore [I.~\textsc{iv.}] the base $AB$ is equal
to $DE$.

Again, since the angles $ACB$, $DFE$ are [\textsc{xx.}] the
halves of the equal angles $AOB$, $DHE$, they are equal
%[File: 153.png]
[I.~Axiom~\textsc{vii.}]. Therefore (Def.~\textsc{x.}) the segments
$ACB$, $DFE$ are similar, and their chords $AB$, $DE$ have

equal. And taking these equals from the whole circles,
which are equal (hyp.), the remaining segments $AGB$,

\textbf{Dem.}---If possible let one of them, such as $AOB$,

are equal (hyp.), the
arc $AL$ is equal to $DE$ [\textsc{xxvi.}]; but $AB$ is equal to $DE$

Hence the two triangles
$AOB$, $DHE$
have the sides $AO$, $OB$ in one respectively equal to
the sides $DH$, $HE$ in the other, and the base $AB$ is
equal to $DE$ (hyp.). Therefore [I.~\textsc{viii.}] the angle
$AOB$ is equal to $DHE$. \emph{Hence the arc $AGB$ is equal

\textit{The angle $ACB$ is a right angle.}

For let $O$ be the centre.
Join $OC$, and produce $AC$ to
$F$. Then because $AO$ is equal
to $OC$, the angle $ACO$ is equal
to the angle $OAC$. In like
manner, the angle $OCB$ is
equal to $CBO$. Hence the
angle $ACB$ is equal to the
sum of the two angles $BAC$,
$CBA$; but [I.\ \textsc{xxxii.}] the
angle $FCB$ is equal to the sum of the two interior

the Proposition is evident,
for the angles are right
angles; but if not, from the

at right angles to the tangent.
Join $BC$. Then because $EF$
is a tangent to the circle,

this centre [\textsc{xix.}]. Therefore
the angle $ACB$ is right [\textsc{xxxi.}]. Hence the sum of the

but the angle $BAF$ is right (const.); therefore the sum

$BAC$, which is common, and we get \emph{the angle $ABC$

Reject them, and we get the \emph{angle $CDA$ equal to

\emph{Or thus:} Take any point
$G$ in the semicircle $AGB$.
Join $AG$, $GB$, $GC$. Then the
angle $AGB = FAB$, each being
right, and $CGB = CAB$ [\textsc{xxi.}].
Therefore the remaining angle
$AGC = FAC$. Again, join $BD$,
$CD$. The angle $BDA = BAE$,
each being right, and $CDB

The angle $BAC$ is equal to
$BDC$ [\textsc{xxi.}]. Now let the point
$B$ move until it becomes consecutive
to $A$; then $AB$ will be
a tangent, and $BD$ will coincide
with $AD$, and the angle $BDC$

shall contain an angle equal to a given angle $(X)$.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{140}{9}{f142}

\textbf{Sol.}---Take any point $A$ in the circumference. Draw
the tangent $AD$, and make the
angle $DAC$ equal to the given
angle $X$. $AC$ will cut off the
required segment.

\textbf{Dem.}---Take any point $B$
in the alternate segment.
Join $BA$, $BC$. Then the
angle $DAC$ is equal to $ABC$
[\textsc{xxxii.}]; but $DAC$ is equal
to $X$ (const.). \emph{Therefore the angle $ABC$ is equal to $X$.}

\myprop{PROP\@.~XXXV\@.---Theorem.}{If two chords $(AB,\ CD)$ of a circle intersect in a point
$(E)$ within the circle, the rectangles $(AE\,.\,EB,\ CE\,.\,ED)$
contained by the segments are equal.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{115}{9}{f143}

\textbf{Dem.}---1. If the point of intersection be the centre,
each rectangle is equal to the square of the radius.
\emph{Hence they are equal.}

2.~Let one of the chords $AB$ pass through the centre
$O$, and cut the other chord $CD$, which does not pass
through the centre, at right angles. Join $OC$. Now
%[File: 161.png]
because $AB$ passes through the centre, and cuts the
other chord $CD$, which does not
pass through the centre at right
angles, it bisects it [\textsc{iii.}]. Again,
because $AB$ is divided equally in
$O$ and unequally in $E$, the rectangle
$AE\,.\,EB$, together with $OE^{2}$,
is equal to $OB^{2}$---that is, to $OC^{2}$
[II\@.~\textsc{v.}]; but $OC^{2}$ is equal to $OE^{2}
+ EC^{2}$ [I.~\textsc{xlvii.}] Therefore
\[
AE\,.\,EB + OE^{2} = OE^{2} + EC^{2}.
\]
Reject $OE^{2}$, which is common, and we have $AE\,.\,EB
= EC^{2}$; but $CE^{2}$ is equal to the rectangle $CE\,.\,ED$,
since $CE$ is equal to $ED$. \emph{Therefore the rectangle
$AE\,.\,EB$ is equal to the rectangle $CE\,.\,ED$.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{110}{8}{f144}

3.~Let $AB$ pass through the centre, and cut $CD$,
which does not pass through the
centre obliquely. Let $O$ be the
centre. Draw $OF$ perpendicular to
$CD$ [I.~\textsc{xi.}]. Join $OC$, $OD$. Then,
since $CD$ is cut at right angles by
$OF$, which passes through the centre,
it is bisected in $F$ [\textsc{iii.}], and divided
unequally in $E$. Hence
\begin{flalign*}
&&           CE\,.\,ED + FE^{2} &= FD^{2} \text{\ [II\@.~\textsc{v.}]},  &&\\
&\text{and }&        OF^{2} &= OF^{2}.  &\phantom{and}&
\end{flalign*}
Hence, adding, since $FE^{2} + OF^{2} = OE^{2}$ [I.~\textsc{xlvii.}], and
$FD^{2} + OF^{2} = OD^{2}$, we get
\[
CE\,.\,ED + OE^{2} = OD \text{\ or } OB^{2}.
\]
Again, since $AB$ is bisected in $O$ and divided unequally
in $E$,
\begin{flalign*}
&&           AE\,.\,EB + OE^{2} &= OB^{2} \text{\ [II\@.~\textsc{v.}].}  &&\\
&\text{Therefore }&  CE\,.\,ED + OE^{2} &= AE\,.\,EB + OE^{2}.  &\phantom{Therefore}&\\
&\text{Hence }&               CE\,.\,ED &= AE\,.\,EB.  &&
\end{flalign*}

4.~Let neither chord pass through the centre.
Through the\label{thopoint} point $E$, where they
intersect, draw the diameter $FG$.
Then by 3, the rectangle $FE\,.\,EG$
is equal to the rectangle $AE\,.\,EB$,
and also to the rectangle $CE\,.\,ED$.
\emph{Hence the rectangle $AE\,.\,EB$ is
equal to the rectangle $CE\,.\,ED$.}

\emph{Cor.}~1.---If a chord of a circle
be divided in any point within
the circle, the rectangle contained by its segments is
equal to the difference between the square of the
radius and the square of the line drawn from the
centre to the point of section.

\emph{Cor.}~2.---If the rectangle contained by the segments
of one of two intersecting lines be equal to the rectangle
contained by the segments of the other, the four
extremities are concyclic.

\textit{Cor.}~3.---\textit{If two triangles be equiangular, the rectangle
contained by the non-corresponding
sides about any two equal angles are
equal.}

\Needspace*{4\baselineskip}

\imgflow{100}{9}{f146}
Let $ABO$, $DCO$ be the equiangular
triangles, and let them be
placed so that the equal angles at
$O$ may be vertically opposite, and
that the non-corresponding sides
$AO$, $CO$ may be in one line; then
the non-corresponding sides $BO$, $OD$ shall be in one
line. Now, since the angle $ABD$ is equal to $ACD$, the
points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are concyclic\label{concylic2} [\textsc{xxi.}, \emph{Cor.}~1]. \emph{Hence
the rectangle $AO\,.\,OC$ is equal to the rectangle $BO\,.\,OD$}
[\textsc{xxxv}.].

\exhead{Exercises.}

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~In any triangle, the rectangle contained by two sides is
equal to the rectangle contained by the perpendicular on the third
side and the diameter of the circumscribed circle.

\textbf{Def.}---\emph{The supplement of an arc is the difference between it and
a semicircle.}

%[File: 163.png]
2.~The rectangle contained by the chord of an arc and the
chord of its supplement is equal to the rectangle contained by
the radius and the chord of twice the supplement.

3.~If the base of a triangle be given, and the sum of the sides,
the rectangle contained by the perpendiculars from the extremities
of the base on the external bisector of the vertical angle is given.

4.~If the base and the difference of the sides be given, the
rectangle contained by the perpendiculars from the extremities
of the base on the internal bisector is given.

5.~Through one of the points of intersection of two circles
draw a secant, so that the rectangle contained by the intercepted
chords may be given, or a maximum.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{135}{16}{f147}

6.~\emph{If the sum of two arcs, $AC$, $CB$ of a circle be less than a
semicircle, the rectangle $AC\,.\,CB$
contained by their chords is equal
to the rectangle contained by the
radius, and the excess of the chord
of the supplement of their difference
above the chord of the supplement of
their sum.}---\textsc{Catalan.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Draw $DE$, the diameter
which is perpendicular to $AB$, and
draw the chords $CF$, $BG$ parallel
to $DE$. Now it is evident that the
difference between the arcs $AC$, $CB$
is equal to $2 CD$, and therefore
$= CD + EF$. Hence the arc $CBF$
is the supplement of the difference, and $CF$ is the chord of that
supplement. Again, since the angle $ABG$ is right, the arc $ABG$
is a semicircle. Hence $BG$ is the supplement of the sum of the
arcs $AC$, $CB$; therefore the line $BG$ is the chord of the supplement
of the sum. Now (Ex.~1), the rectangle $AC\,.\,CB$ is equal
to the rectangle contained by the diameter and $CI$, and therefore
equal to the rectangle contained by the radius and $2 CI$; but the
difference between $CF$ and $BG$ is evidently equal to $2 CI$. \emph{Hence
the rectangle $AC\,.\,CB$ is equal to the rectangle contained by the
radius and the difference between the chords $CF$, $BG$.}

7.~If we join $AF$, $BF$ we find, as before, the rectangle $AF\,.\,FB$
equal to the rectangle contained by the radius and $2 FI$---that
is, equal to the rectangle contained by the radius and the sum of
$CF$ and $BG$. Hence---\emph{If the sum of two arcs of a circle be greater
than a semicircle, the rectangle contained by their chords is equal to
the rectangle contained by the radius, and the sum of the chords of
the supplements of their sum and their difference.}

8.~Through a given point draw a transversal cutting two lines
given in position, so that the rectangle contained by the segments
intercepted between it and the line may be given.
\par\end{footnotesize}
%[File: 164.png]

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXXVI\@.---Theorem.}{If from any point $(P)$ without a circle two lines be drawn
to it, one of which $(PT)$ is a tangent, and the other $(PA)$ a
secant, the rectangle $(AP,\ BP)$ contained by the segments
of the secant is equal to the square of the tangent.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{160}{9}{f148}

\textbf{Dem.}---1. Let $PA$ pass through the centre $O$. Join
$OT$. Then because $AB$ is
bisected in $O$ and divided
externally in $P$, the rectangle
$AP\,.\,BP + OB^{2}$ is
equal to $OP^{2}$ [II\@.~\textsc{vi.}].
But since $PT$ is a tangent,
and $OT$ drawn from the
centre to the point of
contact, the angle $OTP$
is right [\textsc{xviii.}]. Hence $OT^{2} + PT^{2}$ is equal to $OP^{2}$.
\begin{flalign*}
&\text{\indent Therefore\quad}&
  AP\,.\,BP + OB^{2} &= OT^{2} + PT^{2};
&\phantom{\indent Therefore\quad}&
\\
&\text{but }&  OB^{2} &= OT^{2}.  &&\\
&\multispan{2}{\emph{Hence the rectangle\quad \hfill
             $AP\,.\,BP$}} &= PT^{2}.  &&
\end{flalign*}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{167}{9}{f149}

2.~If $AB$ does not pass through the centre $O$, let fall
the perpendicular $OC$
on $AB$. Join $OT$, $OB$,
$OP$. Then because $OC$,
a line through the centre,
cuts $AB$, which does
not pass through the
centre at right angles,
it bisects it [\textsc{iii.}].
Hence, since $AB$ is bisected
in $C$ and divided
externally in $P$, the rectangle
\begin{flalign*}
&&  AP\,.\,BP + CB^{2} &= CP^{2} \text{\ [II\@.~\textsc{vi.}]};  &&\\
&\text{and }&  OC^{2} &= OC^{2}.  &\phantom{and }&
\end{flalign*}
Hence, adding, since $CB^{2} + OC^{2} = OB^{2}$ [I.~\textsc{xlvii.}], and
$CP^{2} + OC^{2} = OP^{2}$, we get
\begin{flalign*}
&\text{rectangle }&  AP\,.\,BP + OB^{2} &= OP^{2};  &&\\
&\text{but }&  OT^{2} + PT^{2} &= OP^{2} \text{\ [I.~\textsc{xlvii.}].} &&\\
&\text{\indent Therefore}&  AP\,.\,BP + OB^2 &= OT^2 + PT^2;
\end{flalign*}
%[File: 165.png]

\noindent and rejecting the equals $OB^2$ and $OT^2$, \emph{we have the
rectangle}
\[
AP\,.\,BP = PT^2.
\]

\begin{footnotesize}
The two Propositions \textsc{xxxv., xxxvi.}, may be included in one
enunciation, as follows:---\emph{The rectangle $AP\,.\,BP$ contained by the
segments of any chord of a given circle passing through a fixed point
$P$, either within or without the circle, is constant.} For let $O$ be
the centre: join $OA$, $OB$, $OP$. Then $OAB$ is an isosceles triangle,
and $OP$ is a line drawn from its vertex to a point $P$ in the base,
or base produced. Then the rectangle $AP\,.\,BP$ is equal to the
difference of the squares of $OB$ and $OP$, and is therefore constant.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\emph{Cor}.~1.---If two lines $AB$, $CD$ produced meet in $P$,
and if the rectangle $AP\,.\,BP = CP\,.\,DP$, the points
$A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are concyclic\label{concylic3} (compare \textsc{xxxv}., \emph{Cor.}~2).

\emph{Cor.}~2.---Tangents to two circles from any point in
their common chord are equal (compare \textsc{xvii}., Ex.~6).

\emph{Cor.}~3.---The common chords of any three intersecting
circles are concurrent (compare \textsc{xvii.}, Ex.~7).

\exhead{Exercise.}

\begin{footnotesize}
If from the vertex $A$ of a $\triangle\ ABC$, $AD$ be drawn, meeting
$CB$ produced in $D$, and making the angle $BAD = ACB$, prove
$DB\,.\,DC = DA^2$.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXXVII\@.---Theorem.}{If the rectangle $(AP\,.\,BP)$ contained by the segments of
a secant, drawn from any point $(P)$ without a circle, be
equal to the square of a line $(PT)$ drawn from the same
point to meet the circle, the line which meets the circle is
a tangent.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{175}{10}{f150}

\textbf{Dem.}---From $P$ draw $PQ$ touching the circle [\textsc{xvii.}].
Let $O$ be the centre.
Join $OP$, $OQ$, $OT$.
Now the rectangle
$AP\,.\,BP$ is equal to the
square on $PT$ (hyp.),
and equal to the square
on $PQ$ [\textsc{xxxvi.}]. Hence
$PT^2$ is equal to $PQ^2$,
and therefore $PT$ is
equal to $PQ$. Again,
%[File: 166.png]
the triangles $OTP$, $OQP$ have the side $OT$ equal $OQ$,
$TP$ equal $QP$, and the base $OP$ common; hence [I.~\textsc{viii.}]
the angle $OTP$ is equal to $OQP$; but $OQP$ is a right
angle, since $PQ$ is a tangent [\textsc{xviii.}]; hence $OTP$ is
right, \emph{and therefore} [\textsc{xvi.}] \emph{$PT$ is a tangent.}

51.~$CD$ is a perpendicular from any point $C$ in a semicircle on
the diameter $AB$; $EFG$ is a circle touching $DB$ in $E$, $CD$ in $F$,
and the semicircle in $G$; prove---(1) that the points $A$, $F$, $G$ are
collinear; (2) that $AC = AE$.

52.~Being given an obtuse-angled triangle, draw from the
obtuse angle to the opposite side a line whose square shall be
equal to the rectangle contained by the segments into which it
divides the opposite side.

53.~$O$ is a point outside a circle whose centre is $E$; two perpendicular
lines passing through $O$ intercept chords $AB$, $CD$ on
the circle; then $AB^{2} + CD^{2} + 4OE^{2} = 8R^{2}$.

54.~The sum of the squares on the sides of a triangle is equal
to twice the sum of the rectangles contained by each perpendicular
and the portion of it comprised between the corresponding vertex
and the orthocentre; also equal to $12R^{2}$ minus the sum of the
squares of the distances of the orthocentre from the vertices.

55.~If two circles touch in $C$, and if $D$ be any point outside the
circles at which their radii through $C$ subtend equal angles, if
$DE$, $DF$ be tangent from $D$, $DE\,.\,DF=DC^{2}$.

\textsf{Observation.}---The following summary of the contents of the
Fourth Book will assist the student in remembering it:---

1.~It contains sixteen Propositions, of which four relate to
triangles, four to squares, four to pentagons, and four miscellaneous
Propositions.

2.~Of the four Propositions occupied with triangles---

($\alpha$) One is to inscribe a triangle in a circle.

($\beta$) Its reciprocal, to describe a triangle about a circle.

($\gamma$) To inscribe a circle in a triangle.

($\delta$) Its reciprocal, to describe a circle about a triangle.

3.~If we substitute in ($\alpha$), ($\beta$), ($\gamma$), ($\delta$) squares for triangles,
and pentagons for triangles, we have the problems for squares
and pentagons respectively.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{180}{9}{f151}

\textbf{Sol.}---Draw any diameter $AC$ of the circle; then, if
$AC$ be equal to $D$,
the thing required is
done; if not, from $AC$
cut off the part $AE$
equal to $D$ [I.~\textsc{iii.}];
and with $A$ as centre
and $AE$ as radius, describe
the circle $EBF$,
cutting the circle $ABC$
in the points $B$, $F$. Join $AB$. \textit{Then $AB$ is the chord
required.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because $A$ is the centre of the circle $EBF$,
$AB$ is equal to $AE$ [I.~Def.~\textsc{xxxii.}]; but $AE$ is equal
to $D$ (const.); \emph{therefore $AB$ is equal to $D$}.

\myprop{PROP\@.~II\@.---Problem.}{In a given circle $(ABC)$ to inscribe a triangle equiangular

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{170}{9}{f152}

\textbf{Sol.}---Take any point $A$ in the circumference, and
at it draw the tangent
$GH$; then make the
angle $HAC$ equal to
$E$, and $GAB$ equal to
$F$ [I.~\textsc{xxiii.}] Join $BC$.
\textit{$ABC$ is a triangle fulfilling
the required conditions.}

\textbf{Dem.}---The angle $E$ is equal to $HAC$ (const.), and
%[File: 175.png]
$HAC$ is equal to the angle $ABC$ in the alternate segment
[III\@.~\textsc{xxxii.}]. Hence the angle $E$ is equal to
$ABC$. In like manner the angle $F$ is equal to $ACB$.
Therefore [I.~\textsc{xxxii.}] the remaining angle $D$ is equal to
$BAC$. \textit{Hence the triangle $ABC$ inscribed in the given
circle is equiangular to $DEF$.}

\myprop{PROP\@.~III\@.---Problem.}{About a given circle $(ABC)$ to describe a triangle equiangular

\textbf{Sol.}---Produce any side $DE$ of the given triangle
both ways to $G$ and $H$, and from the centre $O$ of the
circle draw any radius $OA$; make the angle $AOB$
equal to $GEF$ [I.~\textsc{xxiii.}], and the angle $AOC$ equal to
$HDF$. At the points $A$, $B$, $C$ draw the tangents $LM$,
$MN$, $NL$ to the given circle. \emph{$LMN$ is a triangle fulfilling
the required conditions.}

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{230}{f153}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because $AM$ touches the circle at $A$, the
angle $OAM$ is right. In like manner, the angle $MBO$
is right; but the sum of the four angles of the quadrilateral
$OAMB$ is equal to four right angles. Therefore
the sum of the two remaining angles $AOB$, $AMB$
is two right angles; and [I.~\textsc{xiii.}] the sum of the two
angles $GEF$, $FED$ is two right angles. Therefore the
sum of $AOB$, $AMB$ is equal to the sum of $GEF$, $FED$;
but $AOB$ is equal to $GEF$ (const.). Hence $AMB$ is
%[File: 176.png]
equal to $FED$. In like manner, $ALC$ is equal to
$EDF$; therefore [I.~\textsc{xxxii.}] the remaining angle $BNC$
is equal to $DFE$. \textit{Hence the triangle $LMN$ is equiangular
to $DEF$.}

\myprop{PROP\@.~IV\@.---Problem.}{To inscribe a circle in a given triangle $(ABC)$.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Bisect any two angles $A$, $B$ of the given triangle

Now, in the triangles $OAE$,
$OAF$ the angle $OAE$ is equal to
$OAF$ (const.), and the angle
$AEO$ equal to $AFO$, because
each is right, and the side $OA$
common. Hence [I.~\textsc{xxvi.}] the
side $OE$ is equal to $OF$. In
like manner $OD$ is equal to $OF$;
therefore the three lines $OD$,
$OE$, $OF$ are all equal. And the
circle described with $O$ as centre and $OD$ as radius will
pass through the points $E$, $F$; and since the angles
$D$, $E$, $F$ are right, it will [III\@.~\textsc{xvi.}] touch the three
sides of the triangle $ABC$; \textit{and therefore the circle $DEF$
is inscribed in the triangle $ABC$.}

\imgflow{155}{19}{f155}

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~If the points $O$, $C$ be joined, the angle $C$ is bisected.
Hence ``the bisectors of the angles of a triangle are concurrent''
(compare I.~\textsc{xxvi.}, Ex.~7).

2.~If the sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ of the triangle $ABC$ be denoted by
$a$, $b$, $c$, and half their sum by $s$, the distances of the vertices
$A$, $B$, $C$ of the triangle from the points of contact of the inscribed
circle are respectively $s-a$, $s-b$, $s-c$.

%[File: 177.png]

3.~If the external angles of the triangle $ABC$ be bisected as in
the annexed diagram, the three
angular points $O'$, $O''$, $O'''$, of
the triangle formed by the three
bisectors will be the centres of
three circles, each touching one
side externally, and the other
two produced. These three
circles are called the \emph{escribed}\index{Circle!escribed}
circles of the triangle $ABC$.

4.~The distances of the vertices
$A$, $B$, $C$ from the points
of contact of the escribed circle
which touches $AB$ externally
are $s-b$, $s-a$, $s$.

5.~The centre of the inscribed
circle, the centre of each
escribed circle, and two of the
angular points of the triangle,
are concyclic. Also any two of the escribed centres are concyclic
with the corresponding two of the angular points of the triangle.

6.~Of the four points $O$, $O'$, $O''$, $O'''$, any one is the orthocentre
of the triangle formed by the remaining three.

7.~The three triangles $BCO'$, $CAO''$, $ABO'''$ are equiangular.

8.~The rectangle $CO\,.\,CO''' = ab$; $AO\,.\,AO' = bc$; $BO\,.\,BO''
= ca$.

9.~Since the whole triangle $ABC$ is made up of the three triangles
$AOB$, $BOC$, $COA$, we see that the rectangle contained by
the sum of the three sides, and the radius of the inscribed circle,
is equal to twice the area of the triangle. Hence, if $r$ denote the
radius of the inscribed circle, $rs =$ area of the triangle.

10.~If $r'$ denote the radius of the escribed circle which touches
the side $a$ externally, it may be shown in like manner that
$r'(s-a) =$ area of the triangle.

11.~$rr' = s-b\,.\,s-c$.

12.~Square of area $= s\,.\,s-a\,.\,s-b\,.\,s-c$.

13.~Square of area $= r\,.\,r'\,.\,r''\,.\,r'''$.

14.~If the triangle $ABC$ be right-angled, having the angle $C$
right,
\[
r = s-c;\ r' = s-b;\ r'' = s-a;\ r''' = s.
\]

15.~Given the base of a triangle, the vertical angle, and the
radius of the inscribed, or any of the escribed circles: construct
it.

\textbf{Sol.}---Bisect any two sides $BC$, $AC$ in the points $D$, $E$.
Erect $DO$, $EO$ at right angles to $BC$,
$CA$; \emph{then $O$, the point of intersection
of the perpendiculars, is the centre
of the required circle.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Join $OA$, $OB$, $OC$. The
triangles $BDO$, $CDO$ have the side
$BD$ equal $CD$ (const.), and $DO$ common,
and the angle $BDO$ equal to
the angle $CDO$, because each is
right. Hence [I.~\textsc{iv.}] $BO$ is equal to $OC$. In like
manner $AO$ is equal to $OC$. Therefore the three lines
$AO$, $BO$, $CO$ are equal, and the circle described with
$O$ as centre, and $OA$ as radius, will pass through the
points $A$, $B$, $C$, \emph{and be described about the triangle $ABC$.}

\emph{Cor.}~1.---Since the perpendicular from $O$ on $AB$ bisects
it [III\@.~\textsc{iii.}], we see that the perpendiculars at the
middle points of the sides of a triangle are concurrent.

\textsc{Def.}---\textit{The circle $ABC$ is called the circumcircle\index{Circumcircle}, its
radius the circumradius, and its centre the circumcentre\index{Circumcentre}
of the triangle.}

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~The three perpendiculars of a triangle $(ABC)$ are concurrent.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{103}{10}{f157}

\textbf{Dem.}---Describe a circle about the triangle. Let fall the perpendicular
$CF$. Produce $CF$ to meet the
circle in $G$. Make $FO = FG$. Join $AG$,
$AO$. Produce $AO$ to meet $BC$ in $D$.
Then the triangles $GFA$, $OFA$ have the
sides $GF$, $FA$ in one equal to the sides
$OF$, $FA$ in the other, and the contained
angles equal. Hence [I.~\textsc{iv}.] the angle
$GAF$ equal $OAF$; but $GAF = GCB$
[III\@.~\textsc{xxi}.]; hence $OAF = OCD$, and $FOA
= DOC$; hence $OFA = ODC$; but $OFA$
is right, hence $ODC$ is right. In like
manner, if $BO$ be joined to meet $AC$ in $E$, $BE$ will be perpendicular
to $AC$. \emph{Hence the three perpendiculars pass through $O$,
%[File: 179.png]
and are concurrent.} This Proposition may be proved simply as
follows:---

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{150}{13}{f158}

Draw parallels to the sides of the original triangle $ABC$ through
its vertices, forming a new triangle
$A'B'C'$ described about
$ABC$; then the three perpendiculars
at the middle points of the
sides of $A'B'C'$ are concurrent [\textsc{v.}~\emph{Cor.}~1],
and these are evidently
the perpendiculars from the vertices
on the opposite sides of the
triangle $ABC$ (compare Ex.~16,
Book~I.).

\textbf{Def.}---\textit{The point $O$ is called the
orthocentre\index{Orthocentre} of the triangle $ABC$.}

2.~The three rectangles $OA\,.\,OP$, $OB\,.\,OQ$, $OC\,.\,OR$ are equal.

\textbf{Def.}---\textit{The circle round $O$ as centre, the square of whose radius
is equal $OA\,.\,OP = OB\,.\,OQ = OC\,.\,OR$, is called the polar circle\index{Circle!polar}
of the triangle $ABC$.}

\textsf{Observation.}---If the orthocentre of the triangle $ABC$ be
within the triangle, the rectangles $OA\,.\,OP$, $OB\,.\,OQ$, $OC\,.\,OR$ are
negative, because the lines $OA\,.\,OP$, \&c., are measured in opposite
directions, and have contrary signs; hence the \emph{polar circle} is
imaginary; but it is real when the point $O$ is without the triangle---that
is, when the triangle has an obtuse angle.

3.~If the perpendiculars of a triangle be produced to meet the
circumscribed circle, the intercepts between the orthocentre and
the circle are bisected by the sides of the triangle.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{145}{16}{f159}

4.~The point of bisection $(I)$\label{bisection1} of the line $(OP)$ joining the orthocentre
$(O)$ to the circumference $(P)$
of any triangle is equally distant
from the feet of the perpendiculars,
from the middle points of
the sides, and from the middle
points of the distances of the vertices
from the orthocentre.

\textbf{Dem.}---Draw the perpendicular
$PH$; then, since $OF$, $PH$ are
perpendiculars on $AB$, and $OP$ is
bisected in $I$, it is easy to see that
$IH = IF$. Again, since $OP$, $OG$
are bisected in $I$, $F$; $IF = \frac{1}{2}PG$---that
is, $IF = \frac{1}{2}$ the radius. Hence
the distance of $I$ from the foot of each perpendicular, and from
the middle point of each side, is $= \frac{1}{2}$ the radius. In like manner,
if $OC$ be bisected in $K$, then $IK = \frac{1}{2}$ the radius. Hence we have
%[File: 180.png]
the following theorem:---\emph{The nine points made up of the feet of the
perpendiculars, the middle points of the sides, and the middle points
of the lines from the vertices to the orthocentre, are concyclic.}

\textbf{Def.}---\emph{The circle through these nine points is called the ``nine
points circle''\index{Circle!nine-points} of the triangle.}

5.~The circumcircle of a triangle is the ``nine points circle''
of each of the four triangles formed by joining the centres of the
inscribed and escribed circles.

6.~The distances between the vertices of a triangle and its
orthocentre are respectively the doubles of the perpendiculars
from the circumcentre on the sides.

7.~The radius of the ``nine points circle'' of a triangle is equal
to half its circumradius.

\textbf{Sol.}---Draw any two diameters $AC$, $BD$ at right
angles to each other. Join $AB$,
$BC$, $CD$, $DA$. \emph{$ABCD$ is a square.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $O$ be the centre.
Then the four angles at $O$, being
right angles, are equal. Hence
the arcs on which they stand are
equal [\textsc{III\@.~xxvi.}], and hence the
four chords are equal [\textsc{III\@.~xxix.}].
Therefore the figure $ABCD$ is
equilateral.

Again, because $AC$ is a diameter, the angle $ABC$
is right [\textsc{III\@.~xxxi.}]. In like manner the remaining
angles are right. \emph{Hence $ABCD$ is a square.}

\myprop{PROP\@.~VII\@.---Problem.}{About a given circle $(ABCD)$ to describe a square.}

$A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ the lines $HE$, $EF$, $FG$, $GH$ touching the
circle. \emph{$EFGH$ is a square.}

%[File: 181.png]
%[Illustration]
\imgflow{120}{10}{f161}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because $AE$ touches the circle at $A$, the angle
$EAO$ is right [\textsc{III\@.~xviii.}], and
therefore equal to $BOC$, which
is right (const.). Hence $AE$ is
parallel to $OB$. In like manner
$EB$ is parallel to $AO$; and since
$AO$ is equal to $OB$, the figure
$AOBE$ is a lozenge, and the angle
$AOB$ is right; hence $AOBE$ is a
square. In like manner each of
the figures $BC$, $CD$, $DA$ is a
square. \emph{Hence the whole figure is a square.}

\emph{Cor.}---The circumscribed square is double of the inscribed
square.

\myprop{PROP\@.~VIII\@.---Problem.}{In a given square $(ABCD)$ to inscribe a circle.}

$EH$, $EF$ in the points $A$, $B$, and through $A$, $B$ draw
the lines $AC$, $BD$, respectively parallel to $EF$, $EH$;
\emph{then $O$, the point of intersection of these parallels, is the
centre of the required circle.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because $AOBE$ is a parallelogram, its opposite
sides are equal; therefore $AO$ is equal to $EB$; but
$EB$ is half the side of the given square; therefore $AO$
is equal to half the side of the given square; and so in
like manner is each of the lines $OB$, $OC$, $OD$; therefore
the four lines $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, $OD$ are all equal; and since
they are perpendicular to the sides of the given square,
\emph{the circle described with $O$ as centre, and $OA$ as radius,
will be inscribed in the square.}

\myprop{PROP\@.~IX\@.---Problem.}{About a given square\label{circlesquare} $(ABCD)$ to describe a circle.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Draw the diagonals $AC$, $BD$ intersecting in $O$
(\emph{see} diagram to Proposition \textsc{vi.}). \emph{$O$ is the centre of the
required circle.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Since $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle, and the
%[File: 182.png]
angle $B$ is right, each of the other angles is half a right
angle; therefore $BAO$ is half a right angle. In like
manner $ABO$ is half a right angle; hence the angle
$BAO$ equal $ABO$; therefore [\textsc{I.~vi.}] $AO$ is equal to $OB$.
In like manner $OB$ is equal to $OC$, and $OC$ to $OD$.
\emph{Hence the circle described, with $O$ as centre and $OA$ as
radius, will pass through the points $B$, $C$, $D$, and be

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{130}{11}{f162}

\textbf{Sol.}---Take any line $AB$. Divide it in $C$, so that the
rectangle $AB\,.\,BC$ shall be equal
to $AC^2$ [\textsc{II\@.~xi.}]. With $A$ as centre,
and $AB$ as radius, describe
the circle $BDE$, and in it place
the chord $BD$ equal to $AC$ [\textsc{i.}].
Join $AD$. \emph{$ADB$ is a triangle fulfilling
the required conditions.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Join $CD$. About the
triangle $ACD$ describe the circle
$CDE$ [\textsc{v.}]. Then, because the
rectangle $AB\,.\,BC$ is equal to
$AC^2$ (const.), and that $AC$ is equal to $BD$ (const.);
therefore the rectangle $AB\,.\,BC$ is equal to $BD^2$. Hence
[\textsc{III\@.~xxxii.}] $BD$ touches the circle $ACD$. Hence the
angle $BDC$ is equal to the angle $A$ in the alternate segment
[\textsc{III\@.~xxxii.}]. To each add $CDA$, and we have the
angle $BDA$ equal to the sum of the angles $CDA$ and $A$;
but the exterior angle $BCD$ of the triangle $ACD$ is
equal to the sum of the angles $CDA$ and $A$. Hence the
angle $BDA$ is equal to $BCD$; but since $AB$ is equal to
$AD$, the angle $BDA$ is equal to $ABD$; therefore the
angle $CBD$ is equal to $BCD$. Hence [\textsc{I.~vi.}] $BD$ is
equal to $CD$; but $BD$ is equal to $AC$ (const.); therefore
$AC$ is equal to $CD$, and therefore [\textsc{I.~v.}] the angle
$CDA$ is equal to $A$; but $BDA$ has been proved to be
%[File: 183.png]
equal to the sum of $CDA$ and $A$. Hence $BDA$ is double
of $A$. \textit{Hence each of the base angles of the triangle $ABD$

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~Prove that $ACD$ is an isosceles triangle whose vertical angle

2.~Prove that $BD$ is the side of a regular decagon inscribed in
the circle $BDE$.

3.~If $DB$, $DE$, $EF$ be consecutive sides of a regular decagon
inscribed in a circle, prove $BF - BD =$ radius of circle.

4.~If $E$ be the second point of intersection of the circle $ACD$
with $BDE$, $DE$ is equal to $DB$; and if $AE$, $BE$, $CE$, $DE$ be
joined, each of the triangles $ACE$, $ADE$ is congruent with $ABD$.

5.~$AC$ is the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle
$ACD$, and $EB$ the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in the
circle $BDE$.

6.~Since $ACE$ is an isosceles triangle, $EB^{2} - EA^{2} = AB\,.\,BC$---that
is = $BD^{2}$; therefore $EB^{2} - BD^{2} = EA^{2}$---that is, \textit{the square
of the side of a pentagon inscribed in a circle exceeds the square of
the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle by the square of
the radius.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Construct an isosceles triangle [\textsc{x.}], having
each base angle double the vertical

equiangular to it. Bisect the

$AC$, $BE$. Join $EA$, $ED$, $DC$,
$CB$; \emph{then the figure $ABCDE$ is

\textbf{Dem.}---Because each of the
base angles $BAD$, $ABD$ is
double of the angle $ADB$, and the lines $AC$, $BE$ bisect
them, the five angles $BAC$, $CAD$, $ADB$, $DBE$, $EBA$ are
all equal; therefore the arcs on which they stand are
equal; and therefore the five chords, $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$,
$EA$ are equal. Hence the figure $ABCDE$ is equilateral.

Again, because the arcs $AB$, $DE$ are equal, adding
%[File: 184.png]
the arc $BCD$ to both, the arc $ABCD$ is equal to the arc
$BCDE$, and therefore [III\@.~\textsc{xxvii.}] the angles $AED$,

\imgflow{140}{12}{f164}

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $O$ be the centre of the circle. Join $OE$,
$OA$, $OB$. Now, because the
angles $A$, $E$ of the quadrilateral
$AOEF$ are right angles
[III\@.~\textsc{xviii.}], the sum of the
two remaining angles $AOE$,
$AFE$ is two right angles. In
like manner the sum of the
angles $AOB$, $AGB$ is two
right angles; therefore the
sum of $AOE$, $AFE$ is equal
to the sum of $AOB$, $AGB$;
but the angles $AOE$, $AOB$ are equal, because they
stand on equal arcs $AE$, $AB$ [III\@.~\textsc{xxvii.}]. Hence the
angle $AFE$ is equal to $AGB$. In like manner the
remaining angles of the figure $FGHIJ$ are equal.
\emph{Therefore it is equiangular.}

Again, join $OF$, $OG$. Now the triangles $EOF$, $AOF$
%[File: 185.png]
have the sides $AF$, $FE$ equal [III\@.~\textsc{xvii.}, Ex.~1], and $FO$
common, and the base $AO$ equal to the base $EO$. Hence
the angle $AFO$ is equal to $EFO$ [I.~\textsc{viii.}]. Therefore
the angle $AFO$ is half the angle $AFE$. In like manner
$AGO$ is half the angle $AGB$; but $AFE$ has been
proved equal to $AGB$; hence $AFO$ is equal to $AGO$,
and $FAO$ is equal to $GAO$, each being right, and $AO$
common to the two triangles $FAO$, $GAO$; hence
[I.~\textsc{xxvi.}] the side $AF$ is equal to $AG$; therefore $GF$ is
double $AF$. In like manner $JF$ is double $EF$; but $AF$
is equal to $EF$; hence $GF$ is equal to $JF$. In like
manner the remaining sides are equal; therefore the
figure $FGHIJ$ is equilateral, and it has been proved
equiangular. \emph{Hence it is a regular pentagon.}\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
This Proposition is a particular case of the following general
theorem, of which the proof is the same as the foregoing:---

``If tangents be drawn to a circle, at the angular points of an
inscribed polygon of any number of sides, they will form a regular
polygon of the same number of sides circumscribed to the circle.''
\par\end{footnotesize}

\myprop{PROP\@.~XIII\@.---Problem.}{To inscribe a circle in a regular pentagon $(ABCDE)$.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Bisect two adjacent angles $A$, $B$ by the lines
$AO$, $BO$; \textit{then $O$, the point of intersection of the bisectors,
is the centre of the required circle.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Join $CO$, and let fall perpendiculars from $O$
on the five sides of the pentagon.
Now the triangles
$ABO$, $CBO$ have the side $AB$
equal to $BC$ (hyp.), and $BO$
common, and the angle $ABO$
equal to $CBO$ (const.). Hence
the angle $BAO$ is equal to
$BCO$ [I.~\textsc{iv.}]; but $BAO$ is half
$BAE$ (const.). Therefore $BCO$
is half $BCD$, and therefore $CO$
bisects the angle $BCD$. In
like manner it may be proved that $DO$ bisects the
angle $D$, and $EO$ the angle $E$.

%[File: 186.png]

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{133}{11}{f165}

Again, the triangles $BOF$, $BOG$ have the angle $F$
equal to $G$, each being right; and $OBF$ equal to $OBG$,
because $OB$ bisects the angle $ABC$ (const.), and $OB$
common; hence [\textsc{I.~xxvi.}] $OF$ is equal to $OG$. In like
manner all the perpendiculars from $O$ on the sides of
the pentagon are equal; hence the circle whose centre
is $O$, and radius $OF$, will touch all the sides of the
pentagon, \emph{and will therefore be inscribed in it.}

In the same manner a circle may be inscribed in
any regular polygon.

\myprop{PROP\@.~XIV\@.---Problem.}{To describe a circle about a regular pentagon $(ABCDE)$.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Bisect two adjacent angles $A$, $B$ by the lines
$AO$, $BO$. \emph{Then $O$, the point of intersection of the bisectors,
is the centre of the required circle.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{110}{10}{f166}

\textbf{Dem.}---Join $OC$, $OD$, $OE$. Then the triangles\label{traingles} $ABO$,
$CBO$ have the side $AB$ equal to
$BC$ (hyp.), $BO$ common, and the
angle $ABO$ equal to $CBO$ (const.).
Hence the angle $BAO$ is equal to
$BCO$ [\textsc{I.~iv.}]; but the angle $BAE$
is equal to $BCD$ (hyp.); and since
$BAO$ is half $BAE$ (const.), $BCO$
is half $BCD$. Hence $CO$ bisects
the angle $BCD$. In like manner
it may be proved that $DO$ bisects
$CDE$, and $EO$ the angle $DEA$. Again, because the
angle $EAB$ is equal to $ABC$, their halves are equal.
Hence $OAB$ is equal to $OBA$; therefore [\textsc{I.~vi.}] $OA$ is
equal to $OB$. In like manner the lines $OC$, $OD$, $OE$
are equal to one another and to $OA$. Therefore the
circle described with $O$ as centre, and $OA$ as radius,
will pass through the points $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, \emph{and be described
about the pentagon.}

In the same manner a circle may be described about
any regular polygon.\par\smallskip

%[File: 187.png]

\begin{footnotesize}
Propositions \textsc{xiii.}, \textsc{xiv.} are particular cases of the following
theorem:---

``A regular polygon of any number of sides has one circle inscribed
in it, and another described about it, and both circles are
concentric.''
\end{footnotesize}

\myprop{PROP\@.~XV\@.---Problem.}{In a given circle $(ABCDEF)$ to inscribe a regular hexagon.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Take any point $A$ in the circumference, and
join it to $O$, the centre
of the given circle; then
with $A$ as centre, and $AO$
as radius, describe the
circle $OBF$, intersecting
the given circle in the
points $B$, $F$. Join $OB$,
$OF$, and produce $AO$, $BO$,
$FO$ to meet the given
circle again in the points $D$, $E$, $C$. Join $AB$, $BC$, $CD$,
$DE$, $EF$, $FA$; \emph{$ABCDEF$ is the required hexagon.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{156}{8}{f167}

\textbf{Dem.}---Each of the triangles $AOB$, $AOF$ is equilateral
(\emph{see} Dem., \textsc{I.~i.}). Hence the angles $AOB$, $AOF$
are each one-third of two right angles; therefore $EOF$
is one-third of two right angles. Again, the angles
$BOC$, $COD$, $DOE$ are [\textsc{I.~xv.}] respectively equal to the
angles $EOF$, $FOA$, $AOB$. Therefore the six angles at
the centre are equal, because each is one-third of two
right angles. Therefore the six chords are equal [\textsc{III\@.~xxix.}].
\emph{Hence the hexagon is equilateral.}

Again, since the arc $AF$ is equal to $ED$, to each add
the arc $ABCD$; then the whole arc $FABCD$ is equal to
$ABCDE$; therefore the angles $DEF$, $EFA$ which stand
on these arcs are equal [\textsc{III\@.~xxvii.}]. In the same
manner it may be shown that the other angles of the
hexagon are equal. Hence it is equiangular, \emph{and is
therefore a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle.}

a circle is equal to the radius.

\exhead{Exercises.}

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~The area of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to
twice the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle;
and the square of the side of the triangle is three times the square
of the side of the hexagon.

2.~If the diameter of a circle be produced to $C$ until the produced
part is equal to the radius, the two tangents from $C$ and
their chord of contact form an equilateral triangle.

3.~The area of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is half
the area of an equilateral triangle, and three-fourths of the area
of a regular hexagon circumscribed to the circle.

\myprop{PROP\@.~XVI\@.---Problem.}{To inscribe a regular polygon of fifteen sides in a given circle.}

\textbf{Sol.}---Inscribe a regular pentagon $ABCDE$ in the
circle [\textsc{xi.}], and also an equilateral triangle $AGH$ [\textsc{ii.}].
Join $CG$. \emph{$CG$ is a side of the required polygon.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{110}{9}{f168}

\textbf{Dem.}---Since $ABCDE$ is a regular pentagon, the arc
$ABC$ is $\frac{2}{5}$ths of the circumference;
and since $AGH$ is an equilateral
triangle, the arc $ABG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$rd of
the circumference. Hence the arc
$GC$, which is the difference between
these two arcs, is equal to
$\frac{2}{5}\text{ths} - \frac{1}{3}$rd, or $\frac{1}{15}$th of the entire
circumference; \emph{and therefore, if
chords equal to $GC$} [\textsc{i.}] \emph{be placed
round the circle, we shall have a
regular polygon of fifteen sides, or quindecagon, inscribed
in it.}\par\smallskip

\textit{Scholium}.---Until the year 1801 no regular polygon could be
described by constructions employing the line and circle only,
except those discussed in this Book, and those obtained from
them by the continued bisection of the arcs of which their sides
are the chords; but in that year the celebrated Gauss proved that
if $2^n+1$ be a prime number, regular polygons of $2^n+1$ sides are
inscriptable by elementary geometry. For the case $n=4$, which
is the only figure of this class except the pentagon for which
a construction has been given, see Note at the end of this work.

the remaining two, the six perpendiculars thus obtained are
concurrent.

36.~The greater the number of sides of a regular polygon circumscribed
about a given circle, the less will be its perimeter.

37.~The area of any regular polygon of more than four sides
circumscribed about a circle is less than the square of the diameter.

38.~Four concyclic points taken three by three determine four
triangles, the centres of whose nine-points circles are concyclic.
%[File: 194.png]

39.~If two sides of a triangle be given in position, and if their
included angle be equal to an angle of an equilateral triangle, the
locus of the centre of its nine-points circle is a right line.

40.~If, in the hypothesis and notation of Ex.~34, $\alpha$, $\beta$ denote
any two suffixes whose sum is less than 8, and of which $\alpha$ is the
greater,
\[
\rho_\alpha \rho_\beta = R(\rho_{\alpha - \beta} + \rho_{\alpha + \beta}).
\]

For instance, \quad $\rho_1\rho_4 = R(\rho_3 + \rho_5)$ [\textsc{III\@.~xxxv.}, Ex.~7].

In the same case, if the suffixes be greater than 8,
\[
\rho_\alpha \,.\, \rho_\beta = R(\rho_{\alpha - \beta} - \rho_{17 - \alpha - \beta}).
\]

For instance, \quad $\rho_8 \rho_2 = R(\rho_6 - \rho_7)$ [\textsc{III\@.~xxxv.}, Ex.~6].

41.~Two lines are given in position: draw a transversal through
a given point, forming with the given lines a triangle of given
perimeter.

42.~Given the vertical angle and perimeter of a triangle, construct
it with either of the following data: 1.~The bisector of
the vertical angle; 2.~the perpendicular from the vertical angle
on the base; 3.~the radius of the inscribed circle.

43.~In a given circle inscribe a triangle so that two sides may
pass through two given points, and that the third side may be a

radii of its escribed circles,
\[
r'r'' + r''r''' + r'''r' = s^2.

45.~The feet of the perpendiculars from the extremities of the
base on either bisector of the vertical angle, the middle point of
the base, and the foot of the perpendicular from the vertical
angle on the base, are concyclic.

46.~Given the base of a triangle and the vertical angle; find
the locus of the centre of the circle passing through the centres
of the escribed circles.

47.~The perpendiculars from the centres of the escribed circles
of a triangle on the corresponding sides are concurrent.

48.~If $AB$ be the diameter of a circle, and $PQ$ any chord cutting
$AB$ in $O$, and if the lines $AP$, $AQ$ intersect the perpendicular

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction,}
\textbf{Introduction.}---Every proposition in the theories of
ratio and proportion is true for all descriptions of magnitude.
Hence it follows that the proper treatment is
the Algebraic. It is, at all events, the easiest and the
most satisfactory. Euclid's proofs of the propositions,
in the \textit{Theory of Proportion}, possess at present none
but a historical interest, as no student reads them now.
But although his demonstrations are abandoned, his
propositions are quoted by every writer, and his nomenclature
is universally adopted. For these reasons
it appears to us that the best method is to state Euclid's
definitions, explain them, or prove them when necessary,
for some are theorems under the guise of definitions,
and then supply simple algebraic proofs of his
propositions.

\textsc{i.} A less magnitude is said to be a \emph{part} or \emph{submultiple}\index{Submultiple}
of a greater magnitude, when the less measures
the greater---that is, when the less is contained a certain
number of times exactly in the greater.

\textsc{ii.} A greater magnitude is said to be a \emph{multiple}\index{Multiples} of a
less when the greater is measured by the less---that is,
when the greater contains the less a certain number of
times exactly.

%[File: 197.png]

\textsc{iii.} Ratio\index{Ratio} is the mutual relation of two magnitudes
of the same kind with respect to quantity.

\textsc{iv.} Magnitudes are said to have a \emph{ratio} to one
another when the less can be multiplied so as to
exceed the greater.

These definitions require explanation, especially
Def.~\textsc{iii.}, which has the fault of conveying no precise
meaning---being, in fact, unintelligible.

The following annotations will make them explicit:---\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~If an integer be divided into any number of equal parts,
one, or the sum of any number of these parts, is called a \emph{fraction}.
Thus, if the line $AB$ represent
the integer, and if it be divided
into four equal parts in the
points $C$, $D$, $E$, then $AC$ is $\frac{1}{4}$;
$AD$, $\frac{2}{4}$; $AE$, $\frac{3}{4}$. Thus, a fraction is denoted by two numbers
parted by a horizontal line; the lower, called the \emph{denominator},
denotes the number of equal parts into which the integer is divided;
and the upper, called the \emph{numerator}, denotes the number
of these equal parts which are taken. Hence it follows, that if
the numerator be less than the denominator, the fraction is less
than unity. If the numerator be equal to the denominator, the
fraction is equal to unity; and if greater than the denominator, it
is greater than unity. It is evident that a fraction is an abstract
quantity---that is, that its value is independent of the nature of
the integer which is divided.

2.~If we divide each of the equal parts $AC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EB$ into
two equal parts, the whole, $AB$, will be divided into eight equal
parts; and we see that $AC = \frac{2}{8}$; $AD = \frac{4}{8}$; $AE = \frac{6}{8}$; $AB = \frac{8}{8}$;
Now, we saw in 1, that $AE = \frac{3}{4}$ of the integer, and we have just
shown that it is equal to $\frac{6}{8}$. Hence $\frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{8}$; but $\frac{6}{8}$ would be got
from $\frac{3}{4}$ by multiplying its terms (numerator and denominator)
by $2$. Hence we infer generally that multiplying the terms of
any fraction by $2$ does not alter its value. In like manner it
may be shown that multiplying the terms of a fraction by any
whole number does not alter its value. Hence it follows conversely,
that dividing the terms of a fraction by a whole number
does not alter the value. Hence we have the following important
and fundamental theorem:---\textit{Two transformations can be made on
any fraction without changing its value; namely, its terms can be
either multiplied or divided by any whole number, and in either
case the value of the new fraction is equal to the value of the
original one.}

%[File: 198.png]

3.~If we take any number, such as $3$, and multiply it by any
whole number, the product is called a \emph{multiple} of $3$. Thus $6$, $9$,
$12$, $15$, \&c., are multiples of $3$; but $10$, $13$, $17$, \&c., are not, because
the multiplication of $3$ by any whole number will not produce
them. Conversely, $3$ is a \emph{submultiple}, or \emph{measure}, or \emph{part}
of $6$, $9$, $12$, $15$, \&c., because it is contained in each of these without
a remainder; but not of $10$, $13$, $17$, \&c., because in each case
it leaves a remainder.

\imgflow{150}{6}{f257}

4.~If we consider two magnitudes of the same kind, such as
two lines $AB$, $CD$, and if we suppose that $AB$ is equal to $\frac{3}{4}$ of
$CD$, it is evident, if $AB$ be divided into $3$ equal parts, and $CD$ into
$4$ equal parts, that one of the
parts into which $AB$ is divided
is equal to one of the parts into
which $CD$ is divided. And as
there are $3$ parts in $AB$, and $4$
in $CD$, we express this relation
by saying that $AB$ has to
$CD$ the ratio of $3$ to $4$; and we denote it thus, $3:4$. Hence the
ratio $3:4$ expresses the same idea as the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$. In fact,
both are different ways of expressing and writing the same thing.
When written $3:4$ it is called a ratio\index{Ratio}, and when $\frac{3}{4}$ a fraction.
\emph{In the same manner it can be shown that every ratio whose terms
are commensurable can be converted into a fraction; and, conversely,
every fraction can be turned into a ratio.}\par\smallskip

From this explanation we see that the ratio of any two commensurable
magnitudes is the same as the ratio of the numerical
quantities which denote these magnitudes. Thus, the ratio of
two commensurable lines is the ratio of the numbers which express
their lengths, measured with the same unit. And this may
be extended to the case where the lines are incommensurable\index{Lines!Incommensurable}.
Thus, if $a$ be the side and $b$ the diagonal of a square, the ratio
of $a:b$ is
\[
\frac{a}{b}, \text{\ or } \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

When two quantities are incommensurable, such as the diagonal
and the side of a square, although their ratio is not equal to
that of any two commensurable numbers, yet a series of pairs of
fractions can be found whose difference is continually diminishing,
and which ultimately becomes indefinitely small; such that
the ratio of the incommensurable quantities is greater than one,
and less than the other fraction of each pair. These fractions
are called convergents. By their means we can approximate as
nearly as we please to the exact value of the ratio. In the case
%[File: 199.png]
of the diagonal and the side of a square, the following are the
pairs of convergents:---
\[
  \frac{14}{10},    \ \frac{15}{10};    \ \
  \frac{141}{100},  \ \frac{142}{100};  \ \
  \frac{1414}{1000},\ \frac{1415}{1000};\ \ \&c.,
\]
and the ratio is intermediate to each pair. It is evident we may
continue the series as far as we please. Now if we denote the
first of any of the foregoing pairs of fractions by $\dfrac{m}{n}$, the second
will be $\dfrac{m+1}{n}$; and in general, in the case of two incommensurable
quantities, two fractions $\dfrac{m}{n}$ and $\dfrac{m+1}{n}$ can always be
found, where $n$ can be made as large as we please, one of which
is less and the other greater than the true value of the ratio.
For let $a$ and $b$ be the incommensurable quantities; then, evidently,
we cannot find two multiples $na$, $mb$, such that $na = mb$.
In this case, take any multiple of $a$, such as $na$, then this quantity
must lie between some two consecutive multiples of $b$, such as $mb$,
and $(m + 1)b$; therefore $\dfrac{na}{mb}$ is greater than unity, and $\dfrac{na}{(m+1)b}$
less than unity. Hence $\dfrac{a}{b}$ lies between $\dfrac{m}{n}$ and $\dfrac{m+1}{n}$. Now,
since the difference between $\dfrac{m}{n}$ and $\dfrac{m+1}{n}$ namely, $\dfrac{1}{n}$ becomes
small as $n$ increases, we see that the difference between the ratio
of two incommensurable quantities and that of two commensurable
numbers $m$ and $n$ can be made as small as we please.
Hence, ultimately, the ratio of incommensurable quantities may
be regarded as the limit of the ratio of commensurable quantities.

5.~The two terms of a ratio are called the \emph{antecedent}\index{Antecedent of a ratio}\index{Ratio!antecedent of a} and the
\emph{consequent}\index{Ratio!consequent of a}. These correspond to the numerator and the denominator
of a fraction. Hence we have the following definition:---``\emph{A
ratio is the fraction got by making the antecedent the numerator
and the consequent the denominator.}''

6.~The \emph{reciprocal}\index{Ratio!reciprocal of} of a ratio is the ratio obtained by interchanging
the antecedent and the consequent. Thus, $4 : 3$ is the reciprocal
of the ratio $3 : 4$. Hence we have the following theorem:---``\emph{The
product of a ratio and its reciprocal is unity.}''

7.~If we multiply any two numbers, as $5$ and $7$, by any number
such as $4$, the products $20$, $28$ are called \emph{equimultiples} of $5$ and $7$.
In like manner, $10$ and $15$ are equimultiples of $2$ and $3$, and $18$
and $30$ of $3$ and $5$, \&c.
\par\end{footnotesize}
%[File: 200.png]

\textsc{v.} The first of four magnitudes has to the second
the same ratio which the third has to the fourth, when
any equimultiples whatsoever of the first and third
being taken, and any equimultiples whatsoever of the
second and fourth, if, according as the multiple of the
first is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple
of the second, the multiple of the third is greater than,
equal to, or less than the multiple of the fourth.

\textsc{vi.} Magnitudes which have the same ratio are called
proportionals. When four magnitudes are proportionals,
it is usually expressed by saying, ``The first is to
the second as the third is to the fourth.''

\textsc{viii.} Analogy or proportion is the similitude of
ratios.\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
We have given the foregoing definitions in the order of Euclid,
as given by Simson, Lardner, and others;\footnote{Except that \textsc{viii.}\ is put before \textsc{vii.}, because it relates, as \textsc{v}.\ and
\textsc{vi.}, to the equality of ratios, whereas \textsc{vii.}\ is a test of their
inequality.} but it is evidently an
inverted order; for \textsc{vi.}\ \textsc{viii.}\ are definitions of proportion, and \textsc{v}.\ is
only a test of proportion, and is not a definition but a theorem,
and one which, instead of being taken for granted, requires
proof. The following explanations will give the student clear
conceptions of their meaning:---

1.~If we take two ratios, such as $6 : 9$ and $10 : 15$, which are
each equal to the same thing (in this example each is equal to $\frac{2}{3}$),
they are equal to one another (I.\ Axiom~\textsc{i.}). Then we may
write it thus---
\[
6 : 9 = 10 : 15.
\]
This would be the most intelligible way, but it is not the usual
one, which is as follows:---$6 : 9 :: 10 : 15$. In this form it is
called a \emph{proportion}\index{Proportion}. Hence a proportion consists of two ratios
which are asserted by it to be equal. Its four terms consist of
two antecedents and two consequents. The 1st and 3rd terms
are the \emph{antecedents}, and the 2nd and 4th the \emph{consequents}. Also
the first and last terms are called the \emph{extremes}\index{Proportion!extremes of}, and the two
middle terms the \emph{means}\index{Proportion!means of}.

2.~Since a proportion consists of two equal ratios, and each
%[File: 201.png]
ratio can be written as a fraction, whenever we have a proportion
such as
\[
a : b :: c : d,
\]
we can write it in the form of two equal fractions. Thus:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}.
\]
Conversely, an equation between two fractions can be put into a
proportion. By means of these simple principles all the various
properties of proportion can be proved in the most direct and easy
manner.

3.~If we take the proportion $a : b :: c : d$, and multiply the
first and third terms, each by $m$, and second and fourth, each by
$n$, we get the four multiples, $ma$, $nb$, $mc$, $nd$; and we want to
prove that if $ma$ is greater than $nb$, $mc$ is greater than $nd$; if
equal, equal; and if less, less.
\begin{flalign*}
&\text{\indent\textbf{Dem.}---Since }&
  a : b &:: c : d,
&\phantom{\indent\textbf{Dem.}---Since }&\\
&\text{we have }&
  \frac{a}{b} &= \frac{c}{d}.  &&\\
\intertext{Hence, multiplying each by $\dfrac{m}{n}$ we get}
&&  \frac{ma}{nb} &= \frac{mc}{nd}.  &&
\end{flalign*}
Now, it is evident that if $\dfrac{ma}{nb}$ is greater than unity, $\dfrac{mc}{nd}$ is greater
than unity; but if $\dfrac{ma}{nb}$ is greater than unity, $ma$ is greater than
$nb$; and if $\dfrac{mc}{nd}$ is greater than unity, $mc$ is greater than $nd$. In
like manner, if $ma$ be equal to $nb$, $mc$ is equal to $nd$; and if less,
less.

The foregoing is an easy proof of the converse of the theorem
which is contained in Euclid's celebrated Fifth Definition.

Next, to prove Euclid's theorem---that if, according as the
multiple of the first of four magnitudes is greater than, equal to,
or less than the multiple of the second, the multiple of the third
is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the fourth;
the ratio of the first to the second is equal to the ratio of the
third to the fourth.

%[File: 202.png]
\textbf{Dem.}---Let, $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ be the four magnitudes. First suppose
that $a$ and $b$ are commensurable, then it is evident that we can
take multiples $na$, $mb$, such that $na = mb$. Hence, by hypothesis,
$nc = md$. Thus,
\[
\frac{na}{mb} = 1,\ \frac{nc}{md} = 1;
\]
\begin{flalign*}
&\text{therefore }&&
  \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}.
&\phantom{therefore }&
\end{flalign*}
Next, suppose $a$ and $b$ are incommensurable. Then, as in a recent
note, we can find two numbers $m$ and $n$, such that $\dfrac{na}{mb}$ is greater
than unity, but $\dfrac{na}{(m+1)b}$ less than unity. Hence $\dfrac{a}{b}$ lies between $\dfrac{m}{n}$
and $\dfrac{m+1}{n}$. Now, since by hypothesis, when $\dfrac{na}{mb}$ is greater than
unity, $\dfrac{nc}{md}$ is greater than unity; and when $\dfrac{na}{(m+1)b}$ is less than
unity, $\dfrac{nc}{(m+1)d}$ is less than unity. Hence, since $\dfrac{a}{b}$ lies between
$\dfrac{m}{n}$ and $\dfrac{m+1}{n}$, $\dfrac{c}{d}$ lies between the same quantities. Therefore
the difference between $\dfrac{a}{b}$ and $\dfrac{c}{d}$ is less than $\dfrac{1}{n}$; and since $n$ may
be as large as we please, the difference is nothing;
therefore
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}.
\]
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{vii}. When of the multiples of four magnitudes
(taken as in Def.~\textsc{v.}) the multiple of the first is greater
than that of the second, but the multiple of the third
not greater than that of the fourth, the first has to
the second a greater ratio than the third has to the
fourth.\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
This, instead of being a definition, is a theorem. We have
altered the last clause from that given in Simson's Euclid, which
runs thus:---``The first is \emph{said} to have to the second a greater
ratio than the third has to the fourth.'' This is misleading, as it
implies that it is, by convention, that the first ratio is greater
than the second, whereas, in fact, such is not the case; for it
follows from the hypothesis that the first ratio is greater than
the second; and if it did not, it could not be made so by definition.
%[File: 203.png]
We have made a similar change in the enunciation of the
Fifth Definition.

Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ be the four magnitudes, and $m$ and $n$ the multiples
taken, it is required to prove, that if $ma$ be greater than $nb$,
but $mc$ not greater than $nd$, that the ratio $a : b$ is greater than the
ratio $c : d$.

\medskip
\textbf{Dem.}---Since $ma$ is greater than $nb$, but $mc$ not greater than
$nd$, it is evident that
\begin{flalign*}
&& \frac{ma}{nb}&\ \text{is greater than}\ \frac{mc}{nd}; &&\\
&\text{therefore }&
   \frac{a}{b}&\ \text{is greater than}\ \frac{c}{d}; &\phantom{therefore }&
\end{flalign*}
that is, the ratio $a : b$ is greater than the ratio $c : d$.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{ix}. Proportion consists of three terms at least.

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
This has the same fault as some of the others---it is not a
definition, but an inference. It occurs when the means in a
proportion are equal, so that, in fact, there are four terms. As
an illustration, let us take the numbers $4$, $6$, $9$. Here the ratio of
$4 : 6$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, and the ratio of $6 : 9$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, so that $4$, $6$, $9$ are continued
proportionals; but, in reality, there are four terms, for the full
proportion is $4 : 6 :: 6 : 9$.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{x}. When three magnitudes are continual proportionals,
the first is said to have to the third the
\emph{duplicate}\index{Ratio!duplicate} ratio of that which it has to the second.

\textsc{xi}. When four magnitudes are continual proportionals,
the first is said to have to the fourth the
\emph{triplicate} ratio of that which it has to the second.

\textsc{xii}. When there is any number of magnitudes of the
same kind greater than two, the first is said to have to
the last the ratio compounded\index{Ratio!compound} of the ratios of the first
to the second, of the second to the third, of the third
to the fourth, \&c.

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
We have placed these definitions in a group; but their order
is inverted, and, as we shall see, Def.~\textsc{xii}.\ is a theorem, and \textsc{x}.\
and \textsc{xi}.\ are only inferences from it.

1.~If we have two ratios, such as $5 : 7$ and $3 : 4$, and if we
convert each ratio into a fraction, and multiply these fractions
together, we get a result which is called the ratio compounded of
%[File: 204.png]
the two ratios; viz.~in this example it is $\frac{15}{28}$, or $15 : 28$. It is
evident we get the same result if we multiply the two antecedents
together for a new antecedent, and the two consequents for a
new consequent. Hence we have the following definition:---``\emph{The
ratio compounded\index{Ratio!compound} of any number of ratios it the ratio of
the product of all the antecedents to the product of all the consequents.}''

2.~To prove the theorem contained in Def.~\textsc{xii}.

Let the magnitudes be $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. Then the ratio of
\begin{align*}
\text{1st $:$ 2nd} & = \frac{a}{b}, \\
\text{2nd $:$ 3rd} & = \frac{b}{c}, \\
\text{3rd $:$ 4th} & = \frac{c}{d}.
\end{align*}
Hence the ratio compounded of the ratio of 1st $:$ 2nd, of 2nd $:$ 3rd,
of 3rd $:$ 4th
\[
= \frac{abc}{bcd} = \frac{a}{d} = \text{ratio of 1st $:$ 4th}.
\]

3.~If three magnitudes be proportional, the ratio of the 1st $:$ 3rd
is equal to the square of the ratio of the 1st $:$ 2nd. For the ratio
of the 1st $:$ 3rd is compounded of the ratio of the 1st $:$ 2nd, and
of the ratio of the 2nd $:$ 3rd; and since these ratios are equal,
the ratio compounded of them will be equal to the square of one
of them.

\emph{Or thus}: Let the proportionals be $a$, $b$, $c$, that is, let $a : b :: b : c$;
hence we have
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{a}{b}.
\]
And multiplying each by $\dfrac{a}{b}$, we get
\[
\frac{a}{c} = \frac{a^2}{b^2};
\]
or $a : c :: a^2 : b^2$---that is, 1st $:$ 3rd $::$ square of 1st $:$ square of 2nd.
Now, the ratio of 1st $:$ 3rd is, by Def.~\textsc{x}., the duplicate ratio of
1st $:$ 2nd. Hence the duplicate ratio\index{Ratio!duplicate} of two magnitudes means
the square of their ratio, or, what is the same thing, the ratio of
their squares (see Book VI\@.\ \textsc{xx}.).
%[File: 205.png]

4.~If four magnitudes be continual proportionals, the ratio of
1st $:$ 4th is equal to the cube of the ratio of 1st $:$ 2nd. This may
be proved exactly like 3. Hence we see that what Euclid calls
triplicate ratio of two magnitudes is the ratio of their cubes, or
the cube of their ratio.

We also see that there is no necessity to introduce extraneous
magnitudes for the purpose of defining duplicate and triplicate
ratios, as Euclid does. In fact, the definitions by squares and
cubes are more explicit.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{xiii}. In proportionals, the antecedent terms are
called \emph{homologous}\index{Homologous terms} to one another; as also the consequents
to one another.\par\smallskip

\begin{footnotesize}
If one proportion be given, from it an indefinite number of
other proportions can be inferred, and a great part of the theory
of proportion consists in proving the truth of these derived proportions.
Geometers make use of certain technical terms to
denote the most important of these processes. We shall indicate
these terms by including them in parentheses in connexion with
the Propositions to which they refer. They are useful as indicating,
by one word, the whole enunciation of a theorem.

1.~A ratio of greater inequality is increased by diminishing its

\textsc{i}. \emph{Similar Rectilineal Figures}\index{Figures!similar} are those whose several
angles are equal, each to each, and whose sides about
the equal angles are proportional.

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
Similar figures agree in shape; if they agree also in size, they
are congruent.

1.~When the shape of a figure is given, it is said to be given
in \emph{species}\index{Figures!given in species}. Thus a triangle whose angles are given is given in
species. Hence similar figures are of the same species.

2.~When the size of a figure is given, it is said to be given
in \emph{magnitude}\index{Figures!given in magnitude}; for instance, a square whose side is of given
length.

3.~When the place which a figure occupies is known, it is said
to be given in \emph{position}\index{Figures!given in position}.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{ii}. A right line is said to be cut at a point in
extreme and mean ratio when the whole line is to
the greater segment as the greater segment is to the
less.

\textsc{iii}. If three quantities of the same kind be in continued
proportion, the middle term is called a \emph{mean
proportional}\index{Proportional, mean} between the other two.

Magnitudes in continued proportion are also said to
be in \emph{geometrical progression}.

\textsc{iv}. If four quantities of the same kind be in continued
proportion, the two middle terms are called
two \emph{mean proportionals}\index{Proportionals!two mean} between the other two.

\textsc{v.} The \emph{altitude}\index{Altitude} of any figure is the length of the
perpendicular from its highest point to its base.

\textsc{vi.} Two corresponding angles of two figures have
the sides about them reciprocally proportional, when
a side of the first is to a side of the second as the
remaining side of the second is to the remaining side
of the first.

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
This is evidently equivalent to saying that a side of the first is
to a side of the second in the reciprocal ratio of the remaining
side of the first to the remaining side of the second.

\myprop{PROP\@.~I.---Theorem.}{Triangles $(ABC,\ ACD)$ and parallelograms $(EC,\ CF)$
which have the same altitude are to one another as their

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{190}{6}{f169}

\textbf{Dem.}---Produce $BD$ both ways, and cut off any number
of parts $BG$, $GH$,
\&c., each equal to
$CB$, and any number
$DK$, $KL$, each
equal to $CD$. Join
$AG$, $AH$, $AK$, $AL$.

Now, since the several bases $CB$, $BG$, $GH$ are all
equal, the triangles $ACB$, $ABG$, $AGH$ are also all equal
[I.~\textsc{xxxviii.}]. Therefore the triangle $ACH$ is the
same multiple of $ACB$ that the base $CH$ is of the base
$CB$. In like manner, the triangle $ACL$ is the same
multiple of $ACD$ that the base $CL$ is of the base $CD$;
and it is evident that [I.~\textsc{xxxviii.}] if the base $HC$ be
greater than $CL$, the triangle $HAC$ is greater than
$CAL$; if equal, equal; and if less, less. Now we
have four magnitudes: the base $BC$ is the first, the
base $CD$ the second, the triangle $ABC$ the third, and
the triangle $ACD$ the fourth. We have taken equimultiples
of the first and third, namely, the base
$CH$, and the triangle $ACH$; also equimultiples of the
%[File: 228.png]
second and fourth, namely, the base $CL$, and the triangle
$ACL$; and we have proved that according as the
multiple of the first is greater than, equal to, or less
than the multiple of the second, the multiple of the
third is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple
of the fourth. \textit{Hence} [V.\ Def.~\textsc{v.}] \textit{the base
$BC : CD ::$  the triangle  $ABC : ACD$.}

2.~The parallelogram $EC$ is double of the triangle $ABC$
[I.~\textsc{xxxiv.}], and the parallelogram $CF$ is double of the
triangle $ACD$. Hence [V.~\textsc{xv.}] $EC : CF ::$ the triangle
$ABC : ACD$; but $ABC : ACD :: BC : CD$ (Part~I.).
\textit{Therefore} [V.~\textsc{xi.}] \textit{$EC : CF ::$ the base $BC : CD$.}

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
\emph{Or thus:} Let $A$, $A'$ denote the areas of the triangles $ABC$, $ACD$,
respectively, and $P$ their common altitude; then [II\@.~\textsc{i.}, \emph{Cor.}~1],
\begin{flalign*}
&&  &\, A = \tfrac{1}{2} P\,.\,BC, \quad A' = \tfrac{1}{2} P\,.\,CD.  &&\phantom{Hence }\\
&\text{Hence }&
    &\frac{A}{A'} = \frac{BC}{CD},\text{\ or } A : A' :: BC : CD.  &&

In extending this proof to parallelograms we have only to use
$P$ instead of $\frac{1}{2} P$.

proportionally, the line joining the points of section is

1.~It is required to prove that
$AD : DB :: AE : EC$.

\label{VIi}
\textbf{Dem.}---Join $BE$, $CD$. The triangles
$BDE$, $CED$ are on the same
base $DE$, and between the same parallels
$BC$, $DE$. Hence [I.~\textsc{xxxvii.}] they
are equal, and therefore [V.~\textsc{vii.}] the
triangle $ADE : BDE :: ADE : CDE$;

\begin{flalign*}

that $DE$ is parallel to $BC$.

Therefore [V.~\textsc{ix.}] the triangle $BDE$ is equal to $CDE$,
and they are on the same base $DE$, and on the same
side of it; hence they are between the same parallels
[I.~\textsc{xxxix.}]. \textit{Therefore $DE$ is parallel to $BC$.}

\begin{footnotesize}

the angle $DAC$ is equal to $ACE$;

Because $AD$ is parallel to $EC$, $BA: AE :: BD : DC$
\textsc{[ii.]}; but $BD : DC:: BA : AC$ (hyp.). Therefore
[V.~\textsc{xi}.] $BA : AE :: BA : AC$, and hence [V.~\textsc{ix}.] $AE$

$AED$ are evidently congruent;
therefore the angle $EDB$ is bisected;

2.~Exercise 1 has been proved
by quoting Proposition~\textsc{iii}. Prove
it independently, and prove \textsc{iii}.\ as an inference from it.

3.~The internal and the external bisectors of the vertical angle

4.~Any line intersecting the legs of any angle is cut harmonically

5.~Any line intersecting the legs of a right angle is cut harmonically

points where the internal and external bisectors of $A$ meet $BC$;

\[
DD'=\frac{2abc}{b^2-c^2}.
\]

8.~In the same case, if $E$, $E'$, $F$, $F'$ be points similarly determined
on the sides $CA$, $AB$, respectively; prove

\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{DD'}+\frac{1}{EE'}+\frac{1}{FF'}=0,\\

\mypropl{PROP\@.~IV\@.---Theorem.}{The sides about the equal angles of equiangular triangles
$(BAC,\ CDE)$ are proportional, and those which
are opposite to the equal angles are homologous.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{125}{8}{f173}

\textbf{Dem.}---Let the sides $BC$, $CE$, which are opposite to
the equal angles $A$ and $D$, be conceived to be placed so
as to form one continuous line,
the triangles being on the same
side, and so that the equal
angles $BCA$, $CED$ may not
have a common vertex.

Now, the sum of the angles
$ABC$, $BCA$ is less than two
right angles; but $BCA$ is equal
to $BED$ (hyp.). Therefore the sum of the angles $ABE$,
$BED$ is less than two right angles; hence [I., Axiom
\textsc{xii.}] the lines $AB$, $ED$ will meet if produced. Let them
meet in $F$. Again, because the angle $BCA$ is equal
to $BEF$, the line $CA$ [I.\ \textsc{xxviii.}] is parallel to $EF$. In
%[File: 232.png]
like manner, $BF$ is parallel to $CD$; therefore the figure
$ACDF$ is a parallelogram; hence $AC$ is equal to $DF$,
and $CD$ is equal to $AF$. Now, because $AC$ is parallel
to $FE$, $BA:AF :: BC:CE$ \textsc{[ii.]}; but $AF$ is equal to
$CD$, therefore $BA:CD :: BC:CE$; hence [V.~\textsc{xvi.}];
$AB:BC :: DC:CE$. Again, because $CD$ is parallel
to $BF$, $BC:CE :: FD:DE$; but $FD$ is equal to
$AC$, therefore $BC:CE :: AC:DE$; hence [V.~\textsc{xvi.}]
$BC:AC :: CE:DE$. Therefore we have proved that
$AB:BC :: DC:CE$, and that $BC:CA :: CE:ED$.
Hence (\emph{ex aequali}) $AB:AC :: DC:DE$. \emph{Therefore
the sides about the equal angles are proportional}.

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
This Proposition may also be proved very simply by superposition.
Thus (\emph{see} fig., Prop.~\textsc{ii.}): let the two triangles be $ABC$,
$ADE$; let the second triangle $ADE$ be conceived to be placed on
$ABC$, so that its two sides $AD$, $AE$ may fall on the sides $AB$,
$AC$; then, since the angle $ADE$ is equal to $ABC$, the side $DE$
is parallel to $BC$. Hence \textsc{[ii.]} $AD:DB :: AE:EC$; hence
$AD:AB :: AE:AC$, and [V.~\textsc{xvi.}] $AD:AE :: AB:AC$.
\textit{Therefore the sides about the equal angles $BAC$, $DAE$ are
proportional, and similarly for the others.}

It can be proved by this Proposition that two lines which meet
at infinity are parallel. For, let $I$ denote the point at infinity
through which the two given lines pass, and draw any two parallels
intersecting them in the points $A$, $B$; $A'$, $B'$; then the
triangles $AIB$, $A'IB'$ are equiangular; therefore $AI:AB :: A'I:A'B'$;
but the first term of the proportion is equal to the third;
therefore [V.~\textsc{xiv.}] the second term $AB$ is equal to the fourth
$A'B'$, and, being parallel to it, the lines $AA'$, $BB'$ [I.~\textsc{xxxiii.}]
are parallel.

Then [I.~\textsc{xxxii.}] the triangles
$ABC$, $DEG$ are equiangular.
\begin{flalign*}
&\text{Therefore }&
  BA : AC &:: ED : DG \text{\ [\textsc{iv.}]}; \\
&\text{but }&
  BA : AC &:: ED : DF \text{\ (hyp.)}. 
\end{flalign*}
Therefore $DG$ is equal to $DF$. In like manner it
may be proved that $EG$ is equal to $EF$. Hence the
triangles $EDF$, $EDG$ have the sides $ED$, $DF$ in one
equal to the sides $ED$, $DG$ in the other, and the base
$EF$ equal to the base $EG$. Hence [I.~\textsc{viii.}] they are
equiangular; but the triangle $DEG$ is equiangular to
$ABC$. \textit{Therefore the triangle $DEF$ is equiangular to

\begin{footnotesize}
\textsf{Observation.}---In VI\@.~Def.~\textsc{i.}\ two conditions are laid down
as necessary for the similitude of rectilineal figures. 1.~The
equality of angles; 2.~The proportionality of sides. Now, from
Propositions \textsc{iv.}\ and \textsc{v.}, we see that if two triangles possess either
condition, they also possess the other. Triangles are unique in
this respect. In all other rectilineal figures one of the conditions
may exist without the other. Thus, two quadrilaterals may
have their sides proportional without having equal angles, or
\emph{vice vers{\^a}}.

Therefore $DG$ is equal to $DF$. Again, because the
angle $EDG$ is equal to $BAC$ (const.), and $BAC$ equal

it has been proved that $DG$ is equal to $DF$, and $DE$

Therefore $BG$ is equal to $BC$. Hence the angles

$AGB$ must be obtuse; hence $DFE$, which is equal

\textbf{Dem.}---Since the two triangles $ADC$, $ACB$ have the
angle $A$ common, and the angles
$ADC$, $ACB$ equal, each being
right, they are [I.~\textsc{xxxii.}] equiangular;
hence [\textsc{iv}.] they are
similar. In like manner it may

$AK : KL :: AH : HI$, that is $:: CE : EF$ (const.).
Again, in the triangle $HNG$, $MI$ is parallel to $NG$.

$HM$ is equal to $KL$, $MN$ is equal to $LB$, $HI$ is equal

\textbf{Sol.}---Through $A$ and $B$ draw any two parallels $AC$ and $BD$ in
opposite directions. Cut off $AC = m$, and $BD = n$, and join
$CD$; the joining line will divide $AB$ internally at $E$ in the ratio

$AB$ is equal to $X$, and
$BC$, $AD$ each equal to

\begin{footnotesize}
Another solution can be inferred from Proposition~\textsc{viii.} For if
$AD$, $DC$ in that Proposition be respectively equal to $X$ and $Y$,
then $DB$ will be the third proportional. Or again, if in the diagram,
Proposition~\textsc{viii.}, $AD = X$, and $AC = Y$, $AB$ will be the

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $O$ be the centre of the inscribed circle. Join $OB$
(\emph{see} foregoing fig.); let fall the perpendicular $OG$, draw the diameter
$EF$ of the circumscribed circle. Now the angle $ABE = ECB$
[III\@.~\textsc{xxvii.}], and $ABO = OBC$; therefore $EBO =$ sum of $OCB$,
$OBC = EOB$. Hence $EB = EO$. Again, the triangles $EBF$, $OGC$
are equiangular, because $EFB$, $ECB$ are equal, and $EBF$, $OGC$
are each right. Therefore, $EF:EB::OC:OG$; therefore

contained by its diagonals.

\textbf{Dem.}---Make the angle $DAO = CAB$;
then the triangles $DAO$, $CAB$ are equiangular;
therefore $AD : DO :: AC : CB$;
therefore $AD\,.\,BC = AC\,.\,DO$. Again,
the triangles $DAC$, $OAB$ are equiangular,
and $CD : AC :: BO : AB$; therefore
$AC\,.\,CD = AC\,.\,BO$. Hence $AD\,.\,BC
+ AB\,.\,CD = AC\,.\,BD$.\footnote
 {This Proposition is known as Ptolemy's theorem\index{Ptolemy's theorem}.}

14.~If the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is not cyclic, prove that the
three rectangles $AB\,.\,CD$, $BC\,.\,AD$, $AC\,.\,BD$ are proportional to
the three sides of a triangle which has an angle equal to the sum
of a pair of opposite angles of the quadrilateral.

15.~Prove by using Theorem 11 that if perpendiculars be let
fall on the sides and diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral, from any

contained by the perpendiculars on the diagonals is equal
to the rectangle contained by the perpendiculars on either pair of
opposite sides.

from any point $P$ in the circumference, and if a perpendicular to
AB from any point $C$ meet $PA$, $PB$ in $D$ and $E$, and the semicircle
in $F$, $CF$ is a mean proportional between $CD$ and $CE$.

\textbf{Sol.}---Join $CE$, $CF$, and construct a triangle $ABH$
on $AB$ equiangular to $CDE$, and similarly placed as
regards $CD$; that is, make, the angle $ABH$ equal to
$CDE$, and $BAH$ equal to $DCE$. In like manner construct
the triangle $HAI$ equiangular to $ECF$, and similarly
placed, and lastly, the triangle $IAJ$ equiangular
and similarly placed with $FCG$. \emph{Then $ABHIJ$ is the
figure required.}

\textbf{Dem.}---From the construction it is\label{isis} %[** typo is is corrected and noted]
evident that the
figures are equiangular, and it is only required to prove
that the sides about the equal angles are proportional.
Now because the triangle $ABH$ is equiangular to $CDE$,
$AB : BH :: CD : DE$ [\textsc{iv.}]; hence the sides about the
equal angles $B$ and $D$ are proportional. Again, from
the same triangles we have $BH : HA :: DE : EC$, and
from the triangles $IHA$, $FEC$; $HA : HI :: EC : EF$;
therefore (\emph{ex {\ae}quali}) $BH : HI :: DE : EF$; that is, the
sides about the equal angles $BHI$, $DEF$ are proportional,
and so in like manner are the sides about the
other equal angles. \emph{Hence} (Def.~\textsc{i.}) \emph{the figures are
similar.}

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
\textsf{Observation.}---In the foregoing construction, the line $AB$ is
homologous to $CD$, and it is evident that we may take $AB$ to
be homologous to any other side of the given figure $CDEFG$.
Again, in each case, it the figure $ABHIJ$ be turned round the line
$AB$ until it falls on the other side, it will still be similar to the
figure $CDEFG$. \emph{Hence on a given line $AB$ there can be constructed
two figures each similar to a given figure $CDEFG$, and having the
given line $AB$ homologous to any given side $CD$ of the given figure.}

The first of the figures thus constructed is said to be \emph{directly}
similar\index{Figures!directly similar}, and the second \emph{inversely} similar\index{Figures!inversely similar} to the given figure.
These technical terms are due to Hamilton\index{Hamilton}: \emph{see} ``Elements of
Quaternions,'' page~112.

\emph{Cor.}~1.---Twice as many polygons may be constructed
on $AB$ similar to a given polygon $CDEFG$ as
that figure has sides.

\emph{Cor.}~2.---If the figure $ABHIJ$ be applied to $CDEFG$
so that the point $A$ will coincide with $C$, and that the
line $AB$ may be placed along $CD$, then the points $H$, $I$, $J$
will be respectively on the lines $CE$, $CF$, $CG$; also the
%[File: 250.png]
sides $BH$, $HI$, $IJ$ of the one polygon will be respectively
parallel to their homologous sides $DE$, $EF$, $FG$
of the other.

\emph{Cor.}~3.---If lines drawn from any point $O$ in the
plane of a figure to all its angular points be divided in
the same ratio, the lines joining the points of division
will form a new figure similar to, and having every
side parallel to, the homologous side of the original.

\textbf{Dem.}---Take $BG$ a third proportional to $BC$, $EF$
[\textsc{xi.}]. Join $AG$. Then
because the triangles
$ABC$, $DEF$ are similar,
$AB : BC :: DE : EF$;
hence (alternately) $AB
: DE :: BC : EF$; but
$BC : EF :: EF : BG$
(const.); therefore [V.~\textsc{xi.}]
$AB : DE :: EF :
BG$; hence the sides of the triangles $ABG$, $DEF$ about
the equal angles $B$, $E$ are reciprocally proportional;
therefore the triangles are equal. Again, since the
lines $BC$, $EF$, $BG$ are continual proportionals, $BC : BG$
in the duplicate ratio of $BC : EF$ [V.~Def.~\textsc{x.}]; but
$BC : BG ::$ triangle $ABC : ABG$. Therefore $ABC : ABG$
in the duplicate ratio of $BC : EF$; but it has been
proved that the triangle $ABG$ is equal to $DEF$. \emph{Therefore
the triangle $ABC$ is to the triangle $DEF$ in the
duplicate ratio of $BC : EF$.}

This is the first Proposition in Euclid in which the
technical term ``duplicate ratio'' occurs. My experience
with pupils is, that they find it very difficult to understand
%[File: 251.png]
either Euclid's proof or his definition. On this
account I submit the following alternative proof, which,
however, makes use of a new definition of the duplicate
ratio of two lines, viz.\ the ratio of the squares (\emph{see}
Annotations on V.~Def.~\textsc{x.}) described on these lines.

On $AB$ and $DE$ describe squares, and through $C$ and
$F$ draw lines parallel to $AB$ and $DE$, and complete
the rectangles $AI$, $DN$.

Now, the triangles $JAC$, $ODF$ are evidently equiangular.

number of similar triangles; $(2)$ the corresponding triangles
have the same ratio to one another which the

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $ABHIJ$, $CDEFG$ be the polygons, and
let the sides $AB$, $CD$ be homologous. Join $AH$, $AI$,
$CE$, $CF$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{263}{f198}

1.~The triangles into which the polygons are divided
are similar. For, since the polygons are similar, they
are equiangular, and have the sides about their equal
angles proportional [Def.~\textsc{i.}]; hence the angle $B$ is
equal to $D$, and $AB : BH :: CD : DE$; therefore [\textsc{vi.}]
the triangle $ABH$ is equiangular to $CDE$; hence the
angle $BHA$ is equal to $DEC$; but $BHI$ is equal to $DEF$
(hyp.); therefore the angle $AHI$ is equal to $CEF$.
%[File: 253.png]
Again, because the polygons are similar, $IH : HB ::
FE : ED$; and since the triangles $ABH$, $CDE$ are similar,
$HB : HA :: ED : EC$; hence (\emph{ex aequali}) $IH : HA
:: FE : EC$, and the angle $IHA$ has been proved to be
equal to the angle $FEC$; \emph{therefore the triangles $IHA$,
$FEC$ are equiangular}. In the same manner it can be
proved that \emph{the remaining triangles are equiangular}.

2.~Since the triangle $ABH$ is similar to $CDE$, we
have [\textsc{xix.}].
\[
  ABH : CDE \text{\ in the duplicate ratio of } AH : CE.
\]
In like manner,
\begin{flalign*}
  \multispan{6}{\hfill$
  AHI : CEF \text{\ in the duplicate ratio of } AH : CE;
  $\hfill}  \\
&\text{hence }&
  ABH : CDE &= AHI : CEF\ \text{[V.~\textsc{xi.}]}.  &&\\
&\text{Similarly, }&
  AHI : CEF &= AIJ : CFG.  &&\phantom{Similarly, }
\end{flalign*}
In these equal ratios, the triangles $ABH$, $AHI$, $AIJ$
are the antecedents, and the triangles $CDE$, $CEF$, $CFG$
the consequents, and [V.~\textsc{xii.}] any one of these equal
ratios is equal to the ratio of the sum of all the antecedents
to the sum of all the consequents; \emph{therefore
the triangle $ABH :$ the triangle $CDE ::$ the polygon
$ABHIJ :$ the polygon $CDEFG$.}

3.~The triangle $ABH : CDE$ in the duplicate ratio of
$AB : CD$ [\textsc{xix.}]. \emph{Hence $(2)$ the polygon $ABHIJ :$ the

\emph{Cor.}~1.---The perimeters of similar polygons are to

\emph{Cor.}~2.---As squares are similar polygons, therefore
the duplicate ratio of two lines is equal to the ratio of

\textsc{Def.~i.}---\emph{Homologous points}\index{Points!homologous} in the planes of two
similar figures are such, that lines drawn from them
to the angular points of the two figures are proportional
to the homologous sides of the two figures.

\smallskip
%[Illustration]
\imgflow{190}{11}{f199}

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~If two figures be similar, to each point in the plane of one
there will be a corresponding
point in the
plane of the other.

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $ABCD$,
$A'B'C'D'$ be the two
figures, $P$ a point in
the plane of $ABCD$.
Join $AP$, $BP$, and construct
a triangle $A'P'B'$
on $A'B'$, similar to
$APB$; then it is easy to see that lines from $P'$ to the angular
points of $A'B'C'D'$ are proportional to the lines from $P$ to the
angular points of $ABCD$.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{170}{12}{f200}

2.~If two figures be directly similar, and in the same plane,
there is in the plane a special point which, regarded as belonging
to either figure, is its own
homologous point with respect
to the other. For,
let $AB$, $A'B'$ be two homologous
sides of the figures,
$C$ their point of intersection.
Through the two triads of
points $A$, $A'$, $C$; $B$, $B'$, $C$
describe two circles intersecting
again in the point
$O$: $O$ will be the point required.
For it is evident
that the triangles $OAB$, $OA'B'$ are similar and that either may
be turned round the point $O$, so that the two bases, $AB$, $A'B'$,
will be parallel.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{Def.~ii.}---The point $O$ is called the \emph{centre of similitude\index{Centre!of similitude}
of the figures. It is also called their double point\index{Double point}.}

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
3.~Two regular polygons of $n$ sides each have $n$ centres of
similitude.

%[File: 255.png]
4.~If any number of similar triangles have their corresponding
vertices lying on three given lines, they have a common centre of
similitude.

5.~If two figures be directly similar, and have a pair of homologous
sides parallel, every pair of homologous sides will be
parallel.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\textsc{Def.~iii.}---Two figures, such as those in 5, are said
to be \emph{homothetic}\index{Homothetic}.

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
6.~If two figures be homothetic, the lines joining corresponding
angular points are concurrent, and the point of concurrence is the
centre of similitude of the figures.

7.~If two polygons be directly similar, either may be turned
round their centre of similitude until they become homothetic,
and this may be done in two different ways.

8.~Two circles are similar figures.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{235}{12}{f201}

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $O$, $O'$ be their centres; let the angle $AOB$ be
indefinitely
small, so that
the arc $AB$
may be regarded
as a
right line;
make the
angle $A'O'B'$
equal to $AOB$;
then the triangles
$AOB$,
$A'O'B'$ are similar.

Again, make the angle $BOC$ indefinitely small, and make $B'O'C'$
equal to it; the triangles $BOC$, $B'O'C'$ are similar. Proceeding
in this way, we see that the circles can be divided into the same
number of similar elementary triangles. Hence the circles are
similar figures.

9.~Sectors of circles having equal central angles are similar
figures.

10.~As any two points of two circles may be regarded as homologous,
two circles have in consequence an infinite number of
centres of similitude; their locus is the circle, whose diameter is
the line joining the two points for which the two circles are
homothetic.

%[File: 256.png]
11.~The areas\index{Area} of circles are to one another as the squares of
their diameters. For they are to one another as the similar
elementary triangles into which they are divided, and these are
as the squares of the radii.

12.~The circumferences of circles are as their diameters
(\textit{Cor.}~1).

13.~The circumference of sectors having equal central angles
are proportional to their radii. Hence if $a$, $a'$ denote the arcs of
two sectors, which subtend equal angles at the centres, and if
$r$, $r'$ be their radii, $\dfrac{a}{r} = \dfrac{a'}{r'}$.

14.~The area of a circle is equal to half the rectangle contained
by the circumference and the radius. This is evident by
dividing the circle into elementary triangles, as in Ex.~8.

15.~The area of a sector of a circle is equal to half the rectangle
contained by the arc of the sector and the radius of the
circle.

\textbf{Sol.}---Bisect the side $AC$ opposite to the angle $B$, at
$P:$ through $P$ draw $PE$, $PF$ parallel to the other sides
of the triangle. \emph{$BP$ is the parallelogram required.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{140}{8}{f207}

\textbf{Dem.}---Take any other point $D$ in $AC:$ draw $DG$,
%[File: 262.png]
$DH$ parallel to the sides, and $CK$ parallel to $AB$;
produce $EP$, $GD$ to meet
$CK$ in $K$ and $J$, and produce $HD$ to meet $PK$ in $I$.

Now, since $AC$ is bisected
in $P$, $EK$ is also bisected
in $P$; hence [I.~\textsc{xxxvi.}] the
parallelogram $EO$ is equal
to $OK$; therefore $EO$ is
greater than $DK$; but $DK$ is equal to $FD$ [I.~\textsc{xliii.}];
hence $EO$ is greater than $FD$. To each add $BO$, and
we have the parallelogram $BP$ greater than $BD$.
\emph{Hence $BP$ is the maximum parallelogram which can be
inscribed in the given triangle}.

\emph{Cor}.~1.---The maximum parallelogram exceeds any
other parallelogram ab\-out the same angle in the triangle,
by the area of the similar parallelogram whose
diagonal is the line between the middle point $P$ of the
opposite side and the point $D$, which is the corner of
the other inscribed parallelogram.

\emph{Cor}.~2.---The parallelograms inscribed in a triangle,
and having one angle common with it, are proportional
to the rectangles contained by the segments of the
sides of the triangle, made by the opposite corners of
the parallelograms.

\emph{Cor}.~3.---The parallelogram $AC : GH :: AC^2 :
AD\,.\,DC$.

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXVIII\@.---Problem.}{To inscribe in a given triangle $(ABC)$ a parallelogram
equal to a given rectilineal figure $(X)$ not greater than
the maximum inscribed parallelogram, and having an
angle $(B)$ common with the triangle.}

\textbf{Sol}.---Bisect the side $AC$ opposite to $B$, at $P$. Draw
$PF$, $PE$ parallel to the sides $AB$, $BC$; then [\textsc{xxvii}.] $BP$ is
%[File: 263.png]
the maximum parallelogram that can be inscribed in the
triangle $ABC$; and if $X$ be equal to it, the problem is
solved. If not, produce $EP$, and draw $CJ$ parallel to
$PF$; then describe the parallelogram $KLMN$ [\textsc{xxv.}]
equal to the difference between the figure $PJCF$ and
$X$, and similar to $PJCF$, and so that the sides $PJ$ and
$KL$ will be homologous; then cut off $PI$ equal to $KL$;
draw $IH$ parallel to $AB$, cutting $AC$ in $D$, and draw
$DG$ parallel to $BC$. \emph{$BD$ is the parallelogram required}.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{200}{f208}

\textbf{Dem.}---Since the parallelograms $PC$, $PD$ are about
the same diagonal, they are similar [\textsc{xxiv.}]; but $PC$ is
similar to $KPT$ (const.); therefore $PD$ is similar to $KN$,
and (const.) their homologous sides, $PI$ and $KL$, are
equal; hence [\textsc{xx.}] $PD$ is equal to $KN$. Now, $PD$ is
the difference between $EF$ and $GH$ [\textsc{xxvii.}\ \textit{Cor}.~1], and
$KN$ is (const.) the difference between $PC$ and $X$; therefore
the difference between $PC$ and $X$ is equal to the
difference between $EF$ and $GH$; but $EF$ is equal to $PC$.
\emph{Hence $GH$ is equal to $X$}.

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXIX\@.---Problem.}{To escribe to a given triangle $(ABC)$ a parallelogram
equal to a given rectilineal figure $(X)$, and having an
angle common with an external angle $(B)$ of the triangle.}

\textbf{Sol.}---The construction is the same as the last,
%[File: 264.png]
except that, instead of making the parallelogram $KN$
equal to the excess of the parallelogram $PC$ over the
rectilineal figure $X$, we make it equal to their sum;
and then make $PI$ equal to $KL$; draw $IH$ parallel to
$AB$, and the rest of the construction as before.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{280}{f209}

\textbf{Dem.}---Now it can be proved, as in II\@.~\textsc{vi}., that
the parallelogram $BD$ is equal to the gnomon $OHJ$;
that is, equal to the difference between the parallelograms
$PD$ and $PC$, or the difference (const.) between
$KN$ and $PC$; that is (const.), equal to $X$, and $BD$ is
escribed to the triangle $ABC$, and has an angle common
with the external angle $B$. \textit{Hence the thing required
is done}.

\textsf{Observation.}---The enunciations of the three foregoing Propositions

\myprop{PROP\@.~XXX\@.---Theorem.}{To divide a given line $(AB)$ in ``extreme and mean ratio.''}

\textbf{Sol.}---Divide $AB$ in $C$, so that the rectangle $AB\,.\,BC$
may be equal to the square on $AC$
[II\@.~\textsc{xi}.] \textit{Then $C$ is the point required}.

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{110}{2}{f259}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because the rectangle $AB\,.\,BC$ is equal to the

\exhead{Exercises.}

\begin{footnotesize}
1.~If the three sides of a right-angled triangle be in continued
proportion, the hypotenuse is divided in extreme and mean ratio
by the perpendicular from the right angle on the hypotenuse.

2.~In the same case the greater segment of the hypotenuse is
equal to the least side of the triangle.

3.~The square on the diameter of the circle described about the
triangle formed by the points $F$, $H$, $D$ (\textit{see} fig.~II\@.\ \textsc{xi}.), is equal to
six times the square on the line $FD$.
\par\end{footnotesize}

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXXI\@.---Theorem.}{If any similar rectilineal figure be similarly described
on the three sides of a right-angled triangle $(ABC)$, the
figure on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of those described
on the two other sides.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Draw the perpendicular $CD$ [I.~\textsc{xii}.]. Then
because $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, and $CD$ is
drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the hypotenuse;
$BD:AD$ in the duplicate ratio of $BA:AC$
[\textsc{viii}.~\textit{Cor}.~4]. Again, because the figures described
%[File: 266.png]
on $BA$, $AC$ are similar, they are in the duplicate ratio
of $BA:AC$ [\textsc{xx}.]. Hence [V.~\textsc{xi}.] $BA : AD ::$ figure
described on $BA :$ figure described on AC\@. In like
manner, $AB : BD ::$ figure described on $AB :$ figure
described on $BC$. Hence [V.~\textsc{xxiv}.] $AB :$ sum of $AD$
and $BD ::$ figure described on the line $AB :$ sum of
the figures described on the lines $AC$, $BC$; but $AB$
is equal to the sum of $AD$ and $BD$.
\textit{Therefore} [V.~\textsc{a}.] \textit{the figure described on the line $AB$ is equal to the sum of
the similar figures described on the lines $AC$ and $BC$.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{150}{8}{f210}

\emph{Or thus:} Let us denote the sides by $a$, $b$, $c$, and the
figures by $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$; then because the figures are
similar, we have [\textsc{xx}.]\\[-\baselineskip]
\begin{flalign*}
&&  \alpha : \gamma &:: a^2 : c^2 \\
&\text{therefore}&
  \frac{\alpha}{\gamma} &= \frac{a^2}{c^2}. && \\
&\text{In like manner, }&
   \frac{\beta}{\gamma} &= \frac{b^2}{c^2};
&&\phantom{In }\\
&\text{therefore }&
   \frac{\alpha + \beta}{\gamma}
&= \frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2};  &&
\end{flalign*}
but $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ [I.~\textsc{xlvii}.]. Therefore $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$; that
is, \textit{the sum of the figures on the sides is equal to the figure
on the hypotenuse}.

\exhead{Exercise.}

\begin{footnotesize}
If semicircles be described on supplemental chords of a semicircle,
the sum of the areas of the two crescents thus formed is

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXXII\@.---Theorem.}{If two triangles $(ABC,\ CDE)$ which have two sides of
one proportional to two sides of the other $(AB : BC :: CD : DE)$,
and the contained angles $(B,\ D)$ equal, be joined at
an angle $(C)$, so as to have their homologous sides parallel,
the remaining sides are in the same right line.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{130}{7}{f211}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because the triangles $ABC$, $CDE$ have the
angles $B$ and $D$ equal, and
the sides about these angles
proportional, viz., $AB : BC :: CD : DE$,
they are equiangular
[\textsc{vi}.]; therefore the
angle $BAC$ is equal to $DCE$.
To each add $ACD$, and we have the sum of the angles $BAC$, $ACD$ equal to the
sum of $DCE$ and $ACD$; but the sum of $BAC$, $ACD$ is
[I.~\textsc{xxix}.] two right angles; therefore the sum of $DCE$
and $ACD$ is two right angles. \textit{Hence} [I.~\textsc{xiv}.] \textit{$AC$, $CE$
are in the same right line.}

\mypropl{PROP\@.~XXXIII\@.--Theorem.}{In equal circles, angles $(BOC,\ EPF)$ at the centres or
$(BAC,\ EDF)$ at the circumferences have the same ratio to
one another as the arcs $(BC,\ EF)$ on which they stand,
and so also have the sectors $(BOC,\ EPF)$.}

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{240}{f212}

\textbf{Dem.}---1. Take any number of arcs $CG$, $GH$ in the
first circle, each equal to $BC$. Join $OG$, $OH$, and in
%[File: 268.png]
the second circle take any number of arcs $FI$, $IJ$, each
equal to $EF$. Join $IP$, $JP$. Then because the arcs
$BC$, $CG$, $GH$ are all equal, the angles $BOC$, $COG$, $GOH$,
are all equal [III\@.~\textsc{xxvii.}]. Therefore the arc $BH$ and
the angle $BOH$ are equimultiples of the arc $BC$ and
the angle $BOC$. In like manner it may be proved
that the arc $EJ$ and the angle $EPJ$ are equimultiples
of the arc $EF$ and the angle $EPF$. Again, since the
circles are equal, it is evident that the angle $BOH$
is greater than, equal to, or less than the angle $EPJ$,
according as the arc $BH$ is greater than, equal to, or
less than the arc $EJ$. Now we have four magnitudes,
namely, the arc $BC$, the arc $EF$, the angle $BOC$, and
the angle $EPF$; and we have taken equimultiples of the
first and third, namely, the arc $BH$, the angle $BOH$,
and other equimultiples of the second and fourth,
namely, the arc $EJ$ and the angle $EPJ$, and we have
proved that, according as the multiple of the first is
greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the
second, the multiple of the third is greater than, equal
to, or less than the multiple of the fourth. \textit{Hence}
[V.\ Def.~\textsc{v.}] \textit{$BC: EF::$ the angle $BOC: EPF$.}

Again, since the angle $BAC$ is half the angle $BOC$
[III\@.~\textsc{xx.}], and $EDF$ is half the angle $EPF$,
\begin{flalign*}
&&&&  BAC : EDF &:: BOC : EPF\ &&\text{[V. \textsc{xv}.]}; &&&&\phantom{Hence }\\
&\text{but }&&&
      BOC : EPF &:: BC : EF.   &&  &&&&\\
&\text{Hence }&&&
      BAC : EDF &:: BC : EF\   &&\text{[V. \textsc{xi}.]}.  &&&&
\end{flalign*}

2.~The sector $BOC :$ sector $EPF :: BC : EF$.

\textbf{Dem.}---The same construction being made, since the
arc $BC$ is equal to $CG$, the angle $BOC$ is equal to $COG$.
Hence the sectors $BOC$, $COG$ are congruent (\textit{see} Observation,
Proposition~\textsc{xxix}., Book~III\@.); therefore they
are equal. In like manner the sectors $COG$, $GOH$ are
equal. Hence there are as many equal sectors as there
are equal arcs; therefore the arc $BH$ and the sector
$BOH$ are equimultiples of the arc $BC$ and the sector
%[File: 269.png]
$BOC$. In the same manner it may be proved that the
arc $EJ$ and the sector $EPJ$ are equimultiples of the
arc $EF$ and the sector $EPF$; and it is evident, by
superposition, that if the arc $BH$ is greater than, equal
to, or less than the arc $EJ$, the sector $BOH$ is greater
than, equal to, or less than the sector $EPJ$. \textit{Hence}
[V.\ Def.~\textsc{v}.] \textit{the arc $BC : EF ::$ sector $BOC :$ sector
$EPF$.}

\smallskip
The second part may be proved as follows:---

\begin{footnotesize}
Sector $BOC = \tfrac{1}{2}$ rectangle contained by the arc $BC$, and the
radius of the circle $ABC$ [\textsc{xx.}\ Ex.~14] and sector $EPF = \tfrac{1}{2}$ rectangle
contained by the arc $EF$ and the radius of the circle $EDF$;
and since the circles are equal, their radii are equal. Hence,
sector $BOC :$ sector $EPF ::$ arc $BC :$ arc $EF$.

27.~If a variable circle touch two fixed circles, the chord of
contact passes through a fixed point on the line connecting the
centres of the fixed circles.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{304}{f213}

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $O$, $O'$ be the centres of the two fixed circles; $O''$
the centre of the variable circle; $A$, $B$ the points of contact. Let
$AB$ and $OO'$ meet in $C$, and cut the fixed circles again in the
points $A'$, $B'$ respectively. Join $A'O$, $AO$, $BO'$. Then $AO$, $BO'$
%[File: 274.png]
meet in $O''$ [III\@.~\textsc{xi.}]. Now, because the triangles $OAA'$, $O''AB$
are isosceles, the angle $O''BA = O''AB = OA'A$. Hence $OA'$ is
parallel to $O'B$; therefore $OC : O'C :: OA' : O'B$; that is, in a
given ratio. Hence $C$ is a given point.

28.~If $DD'$ be the common tangent to the two circles, $DD'^{2}
= AB' \,.\, A'B$.

$DD'^{2} : AB^{2} :: (R \pm \rho)(R \pm \rho') : R^{2}$, the choice of sign depending
on the nature of the contacts. This follows from 28.

30.~If four circles be tangential to a fifth, and if we denote by
$\overline{12}$ the common tangent to the first and second, \&c., then
\[
  \overline{12} \,.\, \overline{34}

31.~The inscribed and escribed circles of any triangle are all
touched by its nine-points circle.

32.~The four triangles which are determined by four points,
taken three by three, are such that their nine-points circles
have one common point.

33.~If $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ denote the four sides, and $D$, $D'$ the diagonals
of a quadrilateral; prove that the sides of the triangle, formed by
joining the feet of the perpendiculars from any of its angular

points, are proportional to the three rectangles $ac$, $bd$, $DD'$.

34.~Prove the converse of Ptolemy's theorem\index{Ptolemy's theorem!converse of}\index{Ptolemy's theorem!extension of} (\emph{see} \textsc{xvii.}, Ex.~13).

35.~Describe a circle which shall---(1) pass through a given
point, and touch two given circles; (2)~touch three given
circles.

36.~If a variable circle touch two fixed circles, the tangent to
it from their centre of similitude, through which the chord of contact
passes (27), is of constant length.

Join $IK$, $KL$, $LI$. Now,
the angles $KLG$, $FCG$ are
each [III\@.~\textsc{xxi.}] equal to
the angle $GAD$. Hence they
are equal. Therefore $KL$ is
parallel to $CF$. Similarly,
$LI$ is parallel to $CH$, and
$KI$ to $FH$; hence the triangles

\textbf{Dem.}---Since $AB$ is in the plane $X$, it can be produced
in it [Bk.~I.\ Post.~\textsc{ii.}];
let it be produced to $D$.
Then, if $BC$ be not in $X$,
let any other plane passing
through $AD$ be turned
round $AD$ until it passes
through the point $C$. Now,
because the points $B$, $C$ are in this second plane, the line

$BC$ [I., Def.~\textsc{vi.}] is in it. Therefore the two right lines
$ABC$, $ABD$ lying in one plane have a common segment
$AB$, which is impossible. Therefore, \&c.

%[Illustration]
\mypropflow{PROP\@.~II\@.---Theorem.}{Two right lines $(AB,\ CD)$ which intersect one another

\textbf{Dem.}---Let any plane pass through $EB$, and be turned
round it until it passes through
$C$. Then because the points
$E$, $C$ are in this plane, the right
line $EC$ is in it [I., Def.~\textsc{vi.}].
For the same reason the line $BC$
is in it. \textit{Therefore the lines $EC$,
$CB$, $BE$ are coplanar;} but $AB$
and $CD$ are two of these lines.
\textit{Hence $AB$ and $CD$ are coplanar.}

\myprop{PROP\@.~III\@.---Theorem.}{If two planes $(AB,\ BC)$ cut one another, their common

Then the right lines $BED$,
$BFD$ enclose a space, which
[I., Axiom~\textsc{x.}] is impossible.
\textit{Therefore the common section

\mypropl{PROP\@.~IV\@.---Theorem.}{If a right line $(EF)$ be perpendicular to each of two intersecting

\textit{Cor.}~1.---The normal is the least line that may be
drawn from a given point to a given plane; and of all

\textbf{Dem.}---For if possible let $BC$ be not coplanar with
$BD$, $BE$, and let the plane of $AB$,
$BC$ intersect the plane of $BD$, $BE$
in the line $BF$. Then [XI\@.~\textsc{iii}.]
$BF$ is a right line; and, since it is
coplanar with $BD$, $BE$, which are
each perpendicular to $AB$, it is
[XI\@.~\textsc{iv}.] perpendicular to $AB$.
Therefore the angle $ABF$ is right;
and the angle $ABC$ is right (hyp.).
Hence $ABC$ is equal to $ABF$,
which is impossible [I., Axiom~\textsc{ix}.].

$X$ draw $DE$ at right angles to $BD$;
take any point $E$ in $DE$. Join $BE$,
$AE$, $AD$. Then because $AB$ is
normal to $X$, the angle $ABE$ is
right. Therefore $AE^2 = AB^2 + BE^2
= AB^2 + BD^2 + DE^2$; because the
angle $BDE$ is right. But $AB^2 + BD^2
= AD^2$, because the angle $ABD$
is right. Hence $AE^2 = AD^2 + DE^2$.
Therefore the angle $ADE$ is right.
[I.~\textsc{xlviii}]. And since $CD$ is normal to the plane $X$,
$DE$ is perpendicular to $CD$. Hence $DE$ is a common
perpendicular to the three concurrent lines $CD$, $AD$, $BD$.
%[File: 287.png]
Therefore these lines are coplanar [XI\@.~\textsc{v.}]. But $AB$ is
coplanar with $AD$, $BD$ [XI\@.~\textsc{ii.}]. Therefore the lines
$AD$, $BD$, $CD$ are coplanar; and since the angles $ABD$,

Now in the plane $X$, to
which $AB$ is normal, draw $DE$ at
right angles to $BD$. Take any
point $E$ in $DE$, and join $BE$, $AE$,
$AD$.

Then because $AB$ is normal to
the plane $X$, it is perpendicular to
the line $BE$ in that plane [XI\@.\ Def.~\textsc{vi.}].
Hence the angle $ABE$
is right; therefore $AE^{2} = AB^{2} + BE^{2}

[XI\@.~\textsc{iv.}] $DE$ is perpendicular to $CD$, which is coplanar

\textbf{Dem.}---If the third angle $BAC$ be less than or equal
to either of the other
angles the proposition is
evident. If not, suppose it
greater: take any point
$D$ in $AD$, and at the
point $A$ in the plane $BAC$
make the angle $BAE$
equal $BAD$ [I.~\textsc{xxiii.}],
and cut off $AE$ equal $AD$. Through $E$ draw $BC$, cutting
$AB$, $AC$ in the points $B$, $C$. Join $DB$, $DC$.

Then the triangles $BAD$, $BAE$ have the two sides
$BA$, $AD$ in one equal respectively to the two sides
$BA$, $AE$ in the other, and the angle $BAD$ equal to
$BAE$; therefore the third side $BD$ is equal to $BE$.
But the sum of the sides $BD$, $DC$ is greater than $BC$;
hence $DC$ is greater than $EC$. Again, because the
triangles $DAC$, $EAC$ have the sides $DA$, $AC$ respectively
equal to the sides $EA$, $AC$ in the other, but the
base $DC$ greater than $EC$; therefore [I.~\textsc{xxv.}] the angle

the points $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are coplanar.

coincide with $F'$. In
the same manner the

\textit{Cor}.~1.---\textit{Right prisms which have equal bases $(EF,\ E'F')$
and equal altitudes are equal in volume.}

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{213}{f237}

\textbf{Dem.}---Since the bases are equal, but not similar, we
can suppose one of them, $EF$, divided into parts $A$, $B$, $C$,
and re-arranged so as to make them coincide with the
other [I.~\textsc{xxxv.}, note]; and since the prism on $E'F'$ can
be subdivided in the same manner by planes perpendicular
to the base, the proposition is evident.

\textit{Cor}.~2.---\textit{The volumes of right prisms $(X,\ Y)$ having
equal bases are proportional to their altitudes.}

For, if the altitudes be in the ratio of $m : n$, $X$ can
be divided into $m$ prisms of equal altitudes by planes
parallel to the base; then these $m$ prisms will be all
equal. In like manner, $Y$ can be divided into $n$ equal
prisms. \textit{Hence $X : Y :: m : n$.}

\textit{Cor}.~3.---In right prisms of equal altitudes the
volumes are to one another as the areas of their bases.
This may be proved by dividing the bases into parts
so that the subdivisions will be equal, and then the
volumes proportional to the number of subdivisions in
their respective bases, that is, to their areas.

\textit{Cor}.~4.---The volume of a rectangular parallelopiped
is measured by the continued product of its three dimensions.

$GH$, $OP$ must be in one right line. Now $EF = MN$,
%[File: 302.png]
because each equal $AB$; therefore $ME=NF$; therefore
the prisms $AEM$--$DHP$, and $BFN$--$CGO$, have their
triangular bases $AEM$, $BFN$ identically equal, and
they have equal altitudes; hence they are equal; and
supposing them taken away from the entire solid, \emph{the

then produce $ON$, $PM$ to meet the lines $EF$ and $GH$
produced in the points $J$, $K$, $L$, $I$. Then by $1^{\circ}$ the
parallelopipeds $ABCD$--$EFGH$, $ABCD$--$MNOP$ are each
equal to the parallelopiped $ABCD$--$IJKL$. \emph{Hence they
an equal to one another}.

$2^\circ$. When it is any parallelopiped, $ABCD$--$EFGH$,
the diagonal plane bisects it.

\textbf{Dem.}---Through the vertices $A$, $E$ let planes be
drawn perpendicular to the edges
and cutting them in the points
$I$, $J$, $K$; $L$, $M$, $N$, respectively.
Then [I.~\textsc{xxxiv.}] we have $IL
= BF$, because each is equal to
$AE$. Hence $IB = LF$. In like
manner $JC = MG$. Hence the
pyramid $A$--$IJCB$ agrees in
everything but position with
$E$--$LMGF$; hence it is equal to
it in volume. To each add the
solid $ABC$--$LME$, and we have
the prism $AIJ$--$ELM$ equal to
the prism $ABC$--$EFG$. In like
manner $AJK$--$EMN=ACD$--$EGH$;
but ($1^\circ$) the prism $AIJ$--$ELM
= AJK$--$EMN$. Hence $ABC$--$EFG = ACD$--$EGH$.
\emph{Therefore the diagonal plane bisects the parallelopiped.}

\emph{Cor.}~1.---The volume of a triangular prism is equal
to the product of its base and altitude; because it is
half of a parallelopiped, which has a double base and
equal altitude.

\emph{Cor.}~2.---The volume of any prism is equal to the

divided into triangular prisms.

\myprop{PROP\@.~IV\@.---Theorem.}{If a pyramid $(O$--$ABCDE)$ be cut by any plane $(abcde)$
parallel to the base, the section is similar to the base.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{110}{14}{f241}

\textbf{Dem.}---Because the plane $AOB$ cuts the parallel
planes $ABCDE$, $abcde$, the sections
$AB$, $ab$ are parallel [XI\@.~\textsc{xvi.}]
In like manner $BC$, $bc$ are parallel.
Hence the angle $ABC = abc$
[XI\@.~\textsc{x.}]. In like manner the
remaining angles of the polygon
$ABCDE$ are equal to the corresponding
angles of $abcde$.
Again, because $ab$ is parallel to
$AB$, the triangles $ABO$, $abO$\label{wrongo} are
equiangular.\\[-\baselineskip]
\begin{flalign*}

Therefore the polygons $ABCDE$, $abcde$ are equiangular,
and have the sides about their equal angles proportional.
\emph{Hence they are similar.}

\emph{Cor.}~1.---The edges and the altitude of the pyramid
are similarly divided by the parallel plane.

\emph{Cor.}~2.---The areas of parallel sections are in the

\emph{Cor.}~3.---In any two pyramids, sections parallel to
their bases, which divide their altitudes in the same

\myprop{PROP\@.~V.---Theorem.}{Pyramids $(P$--$ABCD,\ p$--$abc)$, having equal altitudes
$(PO,\ po)$ and bases $(ABCD,\ abc)$ of equal areas, have equal

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{298}{f242}

\textbf{Dem.}---If they be not equal in volume, let $abc$ be
the base of the greater; and let $ox$ be the altitude of a
prism, with an equal base, and whose volume is equal
to their difference; then let the equal altitudes $PO$, $po$
be divided into such a number of equal parts, by planes
parallel to the bases of the pyramids, that each part
shall be less than $ox$. Then [\textsc{iv.}\ \emph{Cor.}~3] the sections
made by these planes will be equal each to each. Now
let prisms be constructed on these sections as bases and
with the equal parts of the altitudes of the pyramids as
altitudes, and let the prisms in $P$--$ABCD$ be constructed
below the sections, and in $p$--$abc$, above. Then it is
evident that the sum of the prisms in $P$--$ABCD$ is
less than that pyramid, and the sum of those on the
sections of $p$--$abc$ greater than $p$--$abc$. Therefore the
%[File: 306.png]
difference between the pyramids is less than the difference
between the sums of the prisms, that is, less than
the lower prism in the pyramid $p$--$abc$; but the altitude
of this prism is less than $ox$ (const.). Hence the difference
between the pyramids is less than the prism
whose base is equal to one of the equal bases, and
whose altitude is equal to $ox$, and the difference is
equal to this prism (hyp.), which is impossible. \emph{Therefore
the volumes of the pyramids are equal.}

\emph{Cor.}~1.---\textit{The volume of a triangular pyramid $E$--$ABC$

For, draw the plane $EAF$, then
the pyramids $E$--$AFC$, $E$--$AFD$
are equal, having equal bases $AFC$,
$AFD$, and a common altitude; and
the pyramids $E$--$ABC$, $F$--$ABC$ are
equal, having a common base and
equal altitudes. Hence the pyramid
$E$--$ABC$ is one of three
equal pyramids into which the
prism is divided. \emph{Therefore it is
one third of the prism.}

Because it may be divided into triangular pyramids
by planes through the vertex and the diagonals of the

cutting it in the lines $OA$,
$OB$, will be faces of a triangular
prism, whose base
will be the triangle $AOB$,
and whose altitude will be
the altitude of the cylinder.
The volume of this prism will be equal to the area of
the triangle $AOB$ by the height of the cylinder. Hence,
dividing the circle into elementary triangles, the cylinder
will be equal to the sum of all the prisms, \textit{and
therefore its volume will be equal to the area of the base

\textbf{Dem}.---Produce the lines $AD$, $BC$ to meet $X$ in the

$X$, the rectangles $ABFE$, $DCFE$ will describe cylinders
whose bases will be circles having $AE$, $DE$ as radii,
%[File: 308.png]
and whose common altitude will be $AB$. Hence the
difference between the volumes of these cylinders will
be equal to the differences between the areas of the bases
multiplied by $AB$, that is $= \pi (AE^{2} - DE^{2})\,.\,AB$.
Therefore the volume described by $ABCD$

\begin{footnotesize}
\textsf{Observation.}---This Cor.\ is a simple case of Guldinus's celebrated
theorem. By its assistance we give in the two following
corollaries original methods of finding the volumes of the cone and

of several other problems which are usually done by the Integral
Calculus.

\emph{Cor.}~3.---\textit{The volume of a cone is one-third the volume
of a cylinder having the same base and altitude.}

%[Illustration]
\imgflow{160}{9}{f246}

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $ABCD$ be a rectangle whose diagonal is
$AC$. The triangle $ABC$ will describe a cone, and the
rectangle a cylinder by revolving round $AB$. Take two
points $E$, $F$ infinitely
near each other in $AC$,
and form two rectangles,
$EH$, $EK$, by drawing
lines parallel to $AD$, $AB$.
Now if $O$, $O'$ be the
middle points of these
rectangles, it is evident
that, when the whole
figure revolves round $AB$, the circumference of the
circle described by $O'$ will ultimately be twice the circumference
of the circle described by $O$; and since the
parallelogram $EK$ is equal to $EH$ [I.~\textsc{xliii}.], the solid
described by $EK$ (\emph{Cor}.~1) will be equal to twice the
solid described by $EH$. Hence, if $AC$ be divided into
%[File: 309.png]
an indefinite number of equal parts, and rectangles
corresponding to $EH$, $EK$ be inscribed in the triangles
$ABC$, $ADC$, the sum of the solids described by the
rectangles in the triangle $ADC$ is equal to twice the
sum of the solids described by the rectangles in the
triangle $ABC$---that is, the difference between the
cylinder and cone is equal to twice the cone. Hence
the cylinder is equal to three times the cone.

\begin{footnotesize}
\emph{Or thus:} We may regard the cone and the cylinder as limiting
cases of a pyramid and prism having the same base and altitude;
and since (v.\ \emph{Cor.}~2) the volume of a pyramid is one-third of the
volume of a prism, having the same base and altitude, the volume
of the cone is one-third of the volume of the cylinder.

\textbf{Dem.}---Let $AB$ be the diameter of the semicircle
which describes the sphere; $ABCD$ the rectangle which
%[File: 310.png]
describes the cylinder. Take two points $E$, $F$ indefinitely
near each other in the semicircle. Join $EF$, which
will be a tangent, and produce it to meet the diameter
$PQ$ perpendicular to $AB$ in $N$. Let $R$ be the centre.
Join $RE$; draw $EG$, $FH$, $NL$ parallel to $AB$; and $EI$,
$FK$ parallel to $PQ$; and produce to meet $LN$ in $M$ and
$L$; and let $O$, $O'$ be the middle points of the rectangles
$EH$, $EK$.

Now the rectangle $NG\,.\,GR = PG\,.\,GQ$, because each
is equal to $GE^{2}$. Hence $NG : GP :: GQ : GR$, or
$ME : IE :: RP+RG : RG$. Now, denoting the radii of
the circles described by the points $O$, $O'$ by $\rho$, $\rho'$ respectively,
we have ultimately $\rho = GR$ and $\rho' =\frac{1}{2}(RP + RG)$.
Hence $ME : IE :: 2\rho' : \rho$; but $ME : IE ::$ rectangle
$EL:$ rectangle $EK ::$ [I.~\textsc{xliii.}] $EH : EK$;
\begin{align*}
&  \therefore EH : EK :: 2\rho' : \rho;  \\
&  \therefore 2\pi\rho \,.\,EH = 2(2\pi\rho' \,.\,EK).
\end{align*}
Hence the solid described by $EH$ equal twice the solid
described by $EK$. Therefore we infer, as in the last
Cor., that the whole volume of the sphere is equal to
twice the difference between the cylinder and sphere.
\emph{Therefore the sphere is two-thirds of the cylinder.}

to meet $AB$ in $G$. Let $O$ be the centre. Join $OE$.\\[-\baselineskip]

Hence $EF : IK :: IG : EG$; and $IG : EG ::$ circumference
of circle described by the point $I :$ circumference
of circle described by the point $E$. Hence the rectangle
contained by $EF$, and circumference of circle described
by $E$ is equal to the rectangle contained by $IK$, and circumference
of circle described by $I$---that is, the portion
of the spherical surface\index{Sphere} described by $EF$ is equal to the
portion of the cylindrical surface described by $IK$.
Hence it is evident, if planes be drawn perpendicular
to the diameter $AB$---that the portions of cylindrical and
spherical surface between any two of them are equal.
\emph{Hence the whole spherical surface is equal to the cylindrical
surface described by $CD$.}

\smallskip
\begin{footnotesize}
\emph{Or thus:} Conceive the whole surface of the sphere divided into
an indefinitely great number of equal parts, then it is evident
that each of these may be regarded as the base of a pyramid
having the centre of the sphere as a common vertex. Therefore
the volume of the sphere is equal to the whole area of the surface
multiplied by one-third of the radius. Hence if $S$ denote the
surface, we have\label{XIvi}
\begin{flalign*}
&&  S \times \frac{r}{3} &= \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}\ \text{[\textsc{vi.}, \emph{Cor.}~6]};  &&\phantom{therefore }\\

That is, the area of the surface of a sphere is equal four times
the area of one of its great circles.

MODERN THEORY OF PARALLEL LINES.
\end{center}

\begin{footnotesize}
In every plane there is one special line called the \emph{line at infinity}.
The point where any other line in the plane cuts the line at infinity
is called the \emph{point at infinity} in that line. All other points in the
line are called \emph{finite points}. Two lines in the plane which meet
the line at infinity in the same point are said to have the \emph{same
direction}, and two lines which meet it in different points to have
\emph{different directions}. Two lines which have the same direction
cannot meet in any finite point [I.\ Axiom~\textsc{x.}], and are parallel.
Two lines which have different directions must intersect in some
finite point, since, if produced, they meet the line at infinity in
different points. This is a fundamental conception in Geometry,
it is self-evident, and may be assumed as an Axiom\index{Axioms} (\emph{see} Observations
on the Axioms, Book~I.). Hence we may infer the following
general proposition:---\emph{``Any two lines in the same plane must
meet in some point in that plane; that is---$(1)$~at infinity, when the
lines have the same direction; $(2)$~in some finite point, when they
have different directions."---\emph{See} \textsc{Poncelet},\index{Poncelet} Propri{\'e}t{\'e}s Projectives},

The discovery of the Proposition that ``the sum of the three

Pythagoras. Until modern times no proof of it, independent of
the theory of parallels, was known. We shall give here two
demonstrations, each independent of that theory. These are due
to two of the greatest mathematicians of modern times---one, the

\textsc{Legendre's Proof.}\index{Legendre}---Let $ABC$ be a triangle, of which the
side $AC$ is the greatest. Bisect $BC$ in $D$. Join $AD$. Then $AD$ is
less than $AC$ [I.~\textsc{xix.}\ Ex.~5]. Now, construct a new triangle
$AB'C'$, having the side $AC' = 2AD$, and $AB' = AC$. Again, bisect
$B'C'$ in $D'$, and form another triangle $AB''C''$, having $AC'' = 2AD'$,
and $AB'' = AC'$, \&c. (1) The sum of the angles of the triangle $ABC
=$ the sum of the angles of $AB'C'$ [I.~\textsc{xvi.} \emph{Cor.}~1] $=$ the sum of the
angles of $AB''C'' =$ the sum of the angles of $AB'''C'''$, \&c. (2) The
angle $B'AC'$ is less than half $BAC$; the angle $B''AC''$ is less than
half $B'AC'$, and so on; hence the angle $B^{(n)} A^{(n)}$ will ultimately
become infinitely small. (3) The sum of the base angles of any
triangle of the series is equal to the angle of the preceding triangle
(\emph{see} Dem.\ I.~\textsc{xvi.}). Hence, if the annexed diagram
represent the triangle $AB^{(n+1)}C^{(n+1)}$, 
the sum of the base angles $A$ and $C^{(n+1)}$ is
%[Illustration]
\imgcent{278}{f261}
equal to the angle $B^{(n)}C^{(n)}$; and when $n$ is indefinitely large, this
angle is an infinitesimal; hence the point $B^{(n+1)}$ will ultimately be
in the line $AC$, and the angle $AB^{(n+1)}C^{(n+1)}$ will become a straight
angle [I.~Def.\ \textsc{x.}], that is, it is equal to two right angles; but the
sum of the angles of $AB^{(n+1)}C^{(n+1)}$ is equal to the sum of the
angles $ABC$. \emph{Hence the sum of the three angles of $ABC$ is equal
to two right angles.}

%[File: 317.png]
$F$, and make $CF$ equal to $CE$. Denote the exterior angles thus
formed by $A'$, $B'$, $C'$. Now let the leg $AC$ of the angle $A'$
be turned round the point $A$ through the angle $A'$; then the point
$C$ will coincide with $D$. Again, let the leg $BD$ of the angle $B'$
be turned round the point $B$ through the angle $B'$, until $BD$ coincides
with $BE$; then the point $D$ will coincide with $E$. Lastly,
let $CE$ be turned round $C$, through the angle $C'$, until $CE$ coincides
with $CF$, and the point $E$ with $F$. Now, it is evident that
by these rotations the point $C$ has been brought successively into
the positions $D$, $E$, $F$; hence, by a motion of mere translation
along the line $FC$, the line $CA$ can be brought into its former
position. Therefore it follows, since rotation is independent of
translation, that the amount of the three rotations is equal to one
complete revolution round the point $A$; therefore $A'+B'+C' =$ four right angles;
but\\[-\baselineskip]

\end{flalign*}

\textsf{Observation.}---The foregoing demonstration is the most
elementary that was ever given of this celebrated Proposition.
I have reduced it to its simplest form, and without making
any use of the language of Quaternions. The same method of
proof will establish the more general Proposition, that the sum
of the external angles of any convex rectilineal figure is equal
to four right angles.

%[File: 318.png]

Mr. Abbott\index{Abbott}, \textsc{f.t.c.d.}, has informed me that this demonstration
was first given by Playfair\index{Playfair} in 1826, so that Hamilton was anticipated.
It has been objected to on the ground that, applied
verbatim to a spherical triangle, it would lead to the conclusion
that the sum of the angles is two right angles, which being
wrong, proves that the method is not valid. A slight consideration
will show that the cases are different. In the proof given
in the text there are three motions of rotation, in each of which
a point describes an arc of a circle, followed by a motion of
translation, in which the same point describes \textit{a right line}, and
returns to its original position. On the surface of a sphere we
should have, corresponding to these, three motions of rotation,
in each of which the point would describe an arc of a circle,
followed by a motion of rotation about the centre of the sphere,
in which the point should describe \textit{an arc of a great circle} to
return to its original position. Hence, the proof for a plane
triangle cannot be applied to a spherical triangle.

Hence, the rectangle and the difference of the lines $MR$ and $PS$
being given, each is given; hence $MR$ is given; but $MR = OM

the rectangle $OM\,.\,ON = R^{2}$; therefore $OM$ and $ON$ are each
given. In like manner, $OP$ and $OQ$ are each given.

Again,

  \rho_6\,.\,\rho_7 = R(\rho_1-\rho_4) = R\,.\,OQ,\ \text{and}\

Hence, since $OQ$ and $ON$ are each given, $\rho_6$ and $\rho_7$ are each given;

\textsc{to find two mean proportionals between two given lines.}
\end{center}

\begin{footnotesize}
The problem to find two mean proportionals is one of the most
celebrated in Geometry on account of the importance which the
ancients attached to it. It cannot be solved by the line and
circle, but is very easy by Conic Sections. The following is a
mechanical construction by the Ruler and Compass.

\textbf{Sol.}---Let the extremes $AB$, $BC$ be placed at right angles to
each other; complete the rectangle $ABCD$, and describe a circle
about it. Produce $DA$, $DC$, and let a graduated ruler be made
to revolve round the point $B$, and so adjusted that $BE$ shall be
equal to $GF$; then $AF$, $CE$ are two mean proportionals between
$AB$, $BC$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{178}{f251}

\textbf{Dem.}---Since $BE$ is equal to $GF$, the rectangle $BE\,.\,GE
= BF\,.\,GF$. Therefore $DE\,.\,CE$\ $= DF\,.\,AF$; hence $DE : DF
:: AF : CE$; and by similar triangles, $AB : AF :: DE : DF$, and
$CE : CB :: DE : DF$. Hence $AB : AF :: AF : CE$; and $AF : CE
:: CE : CB$. Therefore $AB$, $AF$, $CE$, $CB$ are continual proportions.
Hence [VI\@.\ Def.~\textsc{iv.}] $AF$, $CE$ are two mean proportionals
between $AB$ and $BC$.

The foregoing elegant construction is due to the ancient
Geometer \textsc{Philo} of \textsc{Byzantium}. If we join $DG$ it will be
%[File: 321.png]
perpendicular to $EF$. The line $EF$ is called Philo's Line; it
possesses the remarkable property of being the minimum line
through the point $B$ between the fixed lines $DE$, $DF$.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\ibksp\;,,\protect\phantom{.---}Newton's solution,}

lines of which $AB$ is the greater. Bisect $AB$ in $C$. With $A$ as

trial through $A$ a line meeting $BD$, $CD$ produced in the points
$E$, $F$, so that the intercept $EF$ will be equal to the radius of the
circle. $DE$ and $FA$ are the mean proportionals\index{Proportionals!two mean} required.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{190}{f252}

\textbf{Dem.}---Join $AD$. Since the line $BF$ cuts the sides of the
$\triangle\ ACE$, we have
\begin{flalign*}
&&  AB\,.\,CD\,.\,EF &= CB\,.\,DE\,.\,FA;\ \text{but}\ EF = CB;  &&\\
&\rlap{therefore }&
\phantom{therefore } AB\,.\,CD &= DE\,.\,FA,\ \text{or}\ \frac{CD}{DE} = \frac{FA}{AB}. \phantom{therefore } &&
\end{flalign*}
Again, since the $\triangle\ ACD$ is isosceles, we have
\begin{align*}
  ED\,.\,EC &= EA^{2} - AC^{2} = (FA + AC)^{2} - AC^{2}  \\
        &= 2FA\,.\,AC + FA^{2} = FA\,.\,AB + FA^{2}.
\end{align*}
Hence \hfill$
  ED(ED + CD) = FA(AB + FA)$,\hfill \phantom{Hence }\\[1ex]
or \hfill$\displaystyle
  DE^{2}\left(1 + \frac{CD}{DE}\right)
= FA\,.\,AB \left(1 + \frac{AF}{AB}\right) $,\hfill \phantom{or }\\[1ex]
%[File: 322.png]
therefore \ \hfill$DE^2 = FA\,.\,AB$, and we have $AB\,.\,CD = DE\,.\,FA$. \hfill\phantom{therefore }\\[1ex]

\end{center}

\begin{footnotesize}
I am indebted to Professor Galbraith\index{Galbraith} for the following proof
of the minimum property of Philo's Line\index{Lines!Philo's}. It is due to the late
Professor Mac\,Cullagh\index{McCullagh@M$^{c}$Cullagh}:---\emph{Let $AC$, $CB$ be two given lines, $E$ a
fixed point, $CD$ a perpendicular on $AB$; it is required to prove,
if $AE$ is equal to $DB$, that $AB$ is a minimum.}

\textbf{Dem.}---Through $E$ draw $EM$ parallel to $BC$; make $EN = EM$;
produce $AB$ until $EP = AB$. Through the points $N$, $P$ draw
$NT$, $RP$ each parallel to $AC$, and through $P$ draw $PQ$ parallel
to $BC$. It is easy to see from the figure that the parallelogram
$QR$ is equal to the parallelogram $MF$, and is therefore given.
Through $P$ draw $ST$ perpendicular to $EP$. Now, since $AE = DB$,
$BP$ is equal to $DB$; therefore $PS = CD$. Again, since $OP
= AD$, $PT$ is equal to $CD$; therefore $PS = PT$. Hence $QR$
is the maximum parallelogram in the triangle $SVT$.

%[Illustration]
\imgcent{185}{f253}

Again, if any other line $A'B$ be drawn through $E$, and produced
to $P'$, so that $EP' = AP'$, the point $P'$ must fall outside $ST$,
because the parallelogram $Q'R'$, corresponding to $QR$, will be
equal to $MF$, and therefore equal to $QR$. Hence the line $EP'$
%[File: 323.png]
is greater than $EP$, or $A'B'$ is greater than $AB$. Hence $AB$ is a
minimum.

\begin{footnotesize} 
The following mechanical method of trisecting an angle occurred
to me several years ago. Apart from the interest belonging
to the Problem, it is valuable to the student as a geometrical
exercise:---

\smallskip
\emph{To trisect a given angle $ACB$.}

\smallskip
%[Illustration]
\imgcent{204}{f254}

\textbf{Sol.}---Erect $CD$ perpendicular to $CA$; bisect the angle $BCD$
by $CG$, and make the angle $ECI$ equal half a right angle; it is
evident that $CI$ will fall between $CB$ and $CA$. Then, if we use a
jointed ruler---that is two equal rulers connected by a pivot---and
make $CB$ equal to the length of one of these rulers, and, with $C$
as centre and $CB$ as radius, describe the circle $BAM$, cutting
$CI$ in $I$: at $I$ draw the tangent $IG$, cutting $CG$ in $G$.

Then, since $ICG$ is half a right angle, and $CIG$ is right, $IGC$ is
half a right angle; therefore $IC$ is equal to $IG$; but $IC$ equal $CB$;
therefore $IG = CB$---equal length of one of the two equal rulers.
Hence, if the rulers be opened out at right angles, and placed
%[File: 324.png]
so that the pivot will be at $I$, and one extremity at $C$, the other
extremity at $G$; it is evident that the point $B$ will be between
the two rulers; then, while the extremity at $C$ remains fixed, let
the other be made to traverse the line $GF$, until the edge of the
second ruler passes through $B$: it is plain that the pivot moves
along the circumference of the circle. Let $CH$, $HF$, be the positions
of the rulers when this happens; draw the line $CH$; the
angle $ACH$ is one-third of $ACB$.

\textbf{Dem.}---Produce $BC$ to $M$. Join $HM$. Erect $BO$ at right
angles to $BM$. Then, because $CH=HF$, the angle $HCF = HFC$,
and the angle $DCE = ECB$ (const.). Hence the angle $HCD
= HBC$ [I.~\textsc{xxxii.}], and the right angles $ACD$, $CBO$ are equal;
therefore the angle $ACH$ is equal to $HBO$; that is [III\@.~\textsc{xxxii.}],
equal to $HMB$, or to half the angle $HCB$. Hence $ACH$ is one-third
of $ACB$.

{\large NOTE G.}
\medskip

\textsc{on the quadrature of the circle.}\index{Quadrature of circle}
\end{center}

\begin{footnotesize} 
Modern mathematicians denote the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter by the symbol $\pi$. Hence, if $r$ denote
the radius, the circumference will be $2\pi r$; and, since the area of
a circle [VI\@.~\textsc{xx.}\ Ex.~15] is equal to half the rectangle contained
by the circumference and the radius, the area will be $\pi r^2$. Hence,
if the area be known, the value of $\pi$ will be known; and, conversely,
if the value of $\pi$ be known, the area is known. On this
account the determination of the value of $\pi$ is called ``the problem
of the quadrature of the circle,'' and is one of the most celebrated
in Mathematics. It is now known that the value of $\pi$ is incommensurable;
that is, that it cannot be expressed as the ratio of
any two whole numbers, and therefore that it can be found only
approximately; but the approximation can be carried as far as we
please, just as in extracting the square root we may proceed to as
many decimal places as may be required. The simplest approximate
%[File: 325.png]
value of $\pi$ was found by Archimedes, namely, $22: 7$. This
value is tolerably exact, and is the one used in ordinary calculations,
except where great accuracy is required. The next to
this in ascending order, viz. $355: 113$, found by Vieta, is correct
to six places of decimals. It differs very little from the ratio
$3.1416:1$, given in our elementary books.

Several expeditious methods, depending on the higher mathematics,
are known for calculating the value of $\pi$. The following
is an outline of a very simple elementary method for determining
this important constant. It depends on a theorem which is at
once inferred from VI\@., Ex.~87, namely \textit{``If $a$, $A$ denote the reciprocals
of the areas of any two polygons of the same number of sides
inscribed and circumscribed to a circle; $a'$, $A'$ the corresponding quantities
for polygons of twice the number; $a'$ is the geometric mean
between $a $
%[**F2: Incorrect prime removed; see worked example below.]
and $A$, and $A'$ the arithmetic mean between $a'$ and $A$.''}
Hence, if $a$ and $A$ be known, we can, by the processes of finding
arithmetic and geometric means, find $a'$ and $A'$. In like manner,
from $a'$, $A'$ we can find $a''$, $A''$ related to $a'$, $A'$; as $a'$, $A'$ are to
$a$, $A$. Therefore, proceeding in this manner until we arrive at
values $a^{(n)}$, $A^{(n)}$ that will agree in as many decimal places as
there are in the degree of accuracy we wish to attain; and since
the area of a circle is intermediate between the reciprocals of
$a^{(n)}$ and $A^{(n)}$, the area of the circle can be found to any required
degree of approximation.

If for simplicity we take the radius of the circle to be unity,
and commence with the inscribed and circumscribed squares, we
have
\[
\begin{alignedat}{4}
  &a   &&=.5,              &&A   &&=.25. \\
  &a'  &&=.3535533,\qquad  &&A'  &&=.3017766. \\
  &a'' &&=.3264853,        &&A'' &&=.3141315.
\end{alignedat}
\]

These numbers are found thus: $a'$ is the geometric mean between
$a$ and $A$; that is, between $.5$ and $.25$, and $A'$ is the arithmetic
mean between $a'$ and $A$, or between $.3535533$ and $.25$.
Again, $a''$ is the geometric mean between $a'$ and $A'$; and $A''$ the
arithmetic mean between $a''$ and $A'$. Proceeding in this manner,
we find $a^{(13)}=.3183099$; $A^{(13)} =.3183099$. Hence the area of a
%[File: 326.png]
circle radius unity, correct to seven decimal places, is equal to the
reciprocal of $.3183099$; that is, equal to $3.1415926$; or the value
of $\pi$ correct to seven places of decimals is $3.1415926$. The
number $\pi$ is of such fundamental importance in Geometry, that
mathematicians have devoted great attention to its calculation.
\textsc{Mr.\ Shanks}, an English computer, carried the calculation to
$707$ places of decimals. The following are the first $36$ figures
of his result:---
\[
3.141,592,653,589,793,238,462,643,383,279,502,884.
\]

The result is here carried far beyond all the requirements
of Mathematics. Ten decimals are sufficient to give the circumference
of the earth to the fraction of an inch, and thirty
decimals would give the circumference of the whole visible
universe to a quantity imperceptible with the most powerful
microscope.

CONCLUSION.
\end{center}

In the foregoing Treatise we have given the
Elementary Geometry of the Point, the Line, and
the Circle, and figures formed by combinations of
these. But it is important to the student to remark,
that points and lines, instead of being distinct from,
are limiting cases of, circles; and points and planes
limiting cases of spheres. Thus, a circle whose
radius diminishes to zero becomes a point. If, on
the contrary, the circle be continually enlarged, it
may have its curvature so much diminished, that
any portion of its circumference may be made to
differ in as small a degree as we please from a right
line, and become one when the radius becomes infinite.
This happens when the centre, but not the
circumference, goes to infinity.

that our favourable opinion of it has been so convincingly indorsed
by teachers and students in general. The novelty of this
edition is a Supplement of Additional Propositions and Exercises.
This contains an elegant mode of obtaining the circle tangential
to three given circles by the methods of false positions, constructions
for a quadrilateral, and a full account---for the first time in
a text-book---of the Brocard, triplicate ratio, and (what the author
proposes to call) the cosine circles. Dr.~Casey has collected together
very many properties of these circles, and, as usual with
him, has added several beautiful results of his own. He has
done excellent service in introducing the circles to the notice of
English students.\ldots We only need say we hope that this
edition may meet with as much acceptance as its predecessors,
it deserves greater acceptance."

``Dr.~Casey, an eminent Professor of the Higher Mathematics
and Mathematical Physics in the Catholic University of Ireland,
has just brought out a second edition of his unique `Sequel to
the First Six Books of Euclid,' in which he has contrived to
arrange and to pack more geometrical gems than have appeared
in any single text-book since the days of the self-taught Thomas
Simpson. `The principles of Modern Geometry contained in the
work are, in the present state of Science, indispensable in Pure
and Applied Mathematics, and in Mathematical Physics; and it
is important that the student should become early acquainted
with them.'

``Eleven of the sixteen sections into which the work is divided
exhibit most excellent specimens of geometrical reasoning and
research. These will be found to furnish very neat models for
systematic methods of study. The other five sections contain
261 choice problems for solution. Here the earnest student will
find all that he needs to bring himself abreast with the amazing
developments that are being made almost daily in the vast regions
of Pure and Applied Geometry. On pp.~152 and 153 there is an
elegant solution of the celebrated Malfatti's Problem.

``As our space is limited, we earnestly advise every lover of
the `Bright Seraphic Truth' and every friend of the `Mathematical
Magazine' to procure this invaluable book without

propositions in the circle needed in Practical Geometry and Mechanics;
properties of the centres of similitudes, and the theories

Book of Euclid, the chapters on the `Theory of Inversion' and
on the `Poles and Polars' being especially good. Its method
skilfully combines the methods of old and modern Geometry; and
a student well acquainted with its subject-matter would be fairly

of the book. In most cases the proofs are extraordinarily neat.\ldots
The notes to the Sixth Book are the most satisfactory.
Feuerbach's Theorem (the nine-points circle touches inscribed

which are elegant. Dr.~Hart's extension of it is extremely well

to the book when we say, that the proofs of these (Malfatti's

Pure Geometry.

{\LARGE PREFACE.}
\end{center}


Frequent applications having been made to \textsc{Dr. Casey}
requesting him to publish a "Key" containing the
Solutions of the Exercises in his "Elements of Euclid,"
but his professorial and other duties scarcely leaving
him any time to devote to it, I undertook, under his
direction, the task of preparing one. Every Solution
was examined and approved of by him before writing
it for publication, so that the work may be regarded
as virtually his.

The Exercises are a joint selection made by him and
the late lamented Professor Townsend, \textsc{s.f.t.c.d.}, and
form one of the finest collections ever published.

The following are a few of the Opinions received by
Dr. Casey on this Work:---

\begin{footnotesize}
\medskip
``Teachers no longer need be at a loss when asked which of
the numerous `Euclids' they recommend to learners. Dr.~Casey's
will, we presume, supersede all others."---\textsc{The Dublin Evening
Mail}.

\medskip
``Dr.~Casey's work is one of the best and most complete
treatises on Elementary Geometry we have seen. The annotations
on the several propositions are specially valuable to students."---\textsc{The
Northern Whig}.

\medskip
``His long and successful experience as a teacher has eminently
qualified Dr.~Casey for the task which he has undertaken.\ldots
We can unhesitatingly say that this is the best edition of Euclid
that has been yet offered to the public."---\textsc{The Freeman's
Journal}.

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Rev.\ R.~Townsend, F.T.C.D.}, \&c.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

``I have no doubt whatever of the general adoption of your
work through all the schools of Ireland immediately, and of
England also before very long."

\begin{center}
\textit{From} \textsc{George Francis FitzGerald}, Esq., F.T.C.D.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"Your work on Euclid seems admirable, and is a great improvement
in most ways on its predecessors. It is a great thing
to call the attention of students to the innumerable variations in
statement and simple deductions from propositions.\ldots I should
have preferred some modification of Euclid to a reproduction, but
I suppose people cannot be got to agree to any."

\pagebreak
\begin{center}
\textit{From} \textsc{H. J. Cooke}, Esq., The Academy, Banbridge.
\end{center}

"In the clearness, neatness, and variety of demonstrations, it
is far superior to any text-book yet published, whilst the exercises
are all that could be desired."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From} \textsc{James A. Poole}, M.A., 29, Harcourt-street, Dublin.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"This work proves that Irish Scholars can produce Class-books
which even the Head Masters of English Schools will feel it a
duty to introduce into their establishments."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From} \textsc{Professor Leebody}, Magee College, Londonderry.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"So far as I have had time to examine it, it seems to me a
very valuable addition to our text-books of Elementary Geometry,
and a most suitable introduction to the `Sequel to Euclid,' which
I have found an admirable book for class teaching."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From} \textsc{Mrs. Bryant}, F.C.P., Principal of the North London Collegiate
School for Girls.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"I am heartily glad to welcome this work as a substitute for
the much less elegant text-books in vogue here. I have begun
to use it already with some of my classes, and find that the
arrangement of exercises after each proposition works admirably."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Rev. J. E. Reffé}, French College, Blackrock.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"I am sure you will soon be obliged to prepare a Second
Edition. I have ordered fifty copies more of the Euclid (this
makes 250 copies for the French College). They all like the book
here."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Nottingham Guardian}.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"The edition of the First Six Books of Euclid by Dr. John
Casey is a particularly useful and able work.\ldots The illustrative
exercises and problems are exceedingly numerous, and
have been selected with great care. Dr. Casey has done an
undoubted service to teachers in preparing an edition of Euclid
adapted to the development of the Geometry of the present day."

%[File: 341.png]
\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Leeds Mercury}.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"There is a simplicity and neatness of style in the solution of
the problems which will be of great assistance to the students in
mastering them.\ldots At the end of each proposition there is an
examination paper upon it, with deductions and other propositions,
by means of which the student is at once enabled to test
himself whether he has fully grasped the principles involved.\ldots
Dr. Casey brings at once the student face to face with the difficulties
to be encountered, and trains him, stage by stage, to solve
them."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Practical Teacher}.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"The preface states that this book `is intended to supply a
want much felt by Teachers at the present day--the production
of a work which, while giving the unrivalled original in all its
integrity, would also contain the modern conceptions and developments
of the portion of Geometry over which the elements
extend.'

"The book is all, and more than all, it professes to be.\ldots The
propositions suggested are such as will be found to have most
important applications, and the methods of proof are both simple
and elegant. We know no book which, within so moderate
a compass, puts the student in possession of such valuable results.

"The exercises left for solution are such as will repay patient
study, and those whose solution are given in the book itself will
suggest the methods by which the others are to be demonstrated.
We recommend everyone who wants good exercises in Geometry
to get the book, and study it for themselves."

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Educational Times}.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"The editor has been very happy in some of the changes he
has made. The combination of the general and particular enunciations
of each proposition into one is good; and the shortening
of the proofs, by omitting the repetitions so common in Euclid, is
another improvement. The use of the contra-positive of a proved
theorem is introduced with advantage, in place of the \textit{reductio ad
absurdum}; while the alternative (or, in some cases, substituted)
proofs are numerous, many of them being not only elegant but
eminently suggestive. The notes at the end of the book are of
great interest, and much of the matter is not easily accessible.
The collection of exercises, `of which there are nearly eight
hundred,' is another feature which will commend the book to
teachers. To sum up, we think that this work ought to be read
by every teacher of Geometry; and we make bold to say that no
one can study it without gaining valuable information, and still
more valuable suggestions."

\begin{center}
\textit{From the} \textsc{Journal of Education}, Sept. 1, 1883.
\end{center}
\nopagebreak

"In the text of the propositions, the author has adhered, in all
but a few instances, to the substance of Euclid's demonstrations,
without, however, giving way to a slavish following of his occasional
verbiage and redundance. The use of letters in brackets
in the enunciations eludes the necessity of giving a second or
particular enunciation, and can do no harm. Hints of other
proofs are often given in small type at the end of a proposition,
and, where necessary, short explanations. The definitions are
also carefully annotated. The theory of proportion, Book V., is
given in an algebraical form. This book has always appeared to
us an exquisitely subtle example of Greek mathematical logic,
but the subject can be made infinitely simpler and shorter by a
little algebra, and naturally the more difficult method has yielded
place to the less. It is not studied in schools, it is not asked for
even in the Cambridge Tripos; a few years ago, it still survived
in one of the College Examinations at St. John's, but whether
the reforming spirit which is dominant there has left it, we do
not know. The book contains a very large body of riders and
independent geometrical problems. The simpler of these are
given in immediate connexion with the propositions to which
they naturally attach; the more difficult are given in collections
at the end of each book. Some of these are solved in the book,
and these include many well-known theorems, properties of orthocentre,
of nine-point circle, \&c. In every way this edition of
Euclid is deserving of commendation. We would also express a
hope that everyone who uses this book will afterwards read the
same author's `Sequel to Euclid,' where he will find an excellent
account of more modern Geometry."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If
you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with
the rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any
purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances
and research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you
may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially
commercial redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

page at http://pglaf.org

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org


Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
